\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Humans reason about space on a qualitative level, this means we think about our environment in (qualitative) terms such as, "the elm tree is next-to the house", instead of (quantitative) terms like, "the exterior part of the elm tree is 4.54 meters away from the exterior part of the house". The main distinction between the two is based on the level of spatial abstraction; qualitative represents a high level while quantitative represent a low level of abstraction. Our natural cognitive intuition to use qualitative instead of quantitative is the crux of how humans efficiently and effectively represent and reason about our spatial environments and is the topic of much research \cite{freksa1991qsr} \cite{Cohn:2001:QSR}.

%The domain of architectural design is quite interesting in this respect because it relies on both aspects of space: qualitative and quantitative. In the architectural design literature \cite{} this distinction is commonly reffed to as \emph{form} and \emph{function}, in which the common phrase goes "\emph{form follows function}" \cite{formfunction}. In general, the context of this phrase supports the doctrine that the form (structure) should be determined by its function (purpose). For decades there has been a plethora of debate on the interpretation of these claims and its validity with a practical design context. For the purposes here the focus is not on the philosophy of design or any argument about the validity of such claims, but is an introduction to the idea that architectural design is inherently defined by and intertwined with the qualitative and quantitative aspects of space.

%Research that supports this perspective on design and space, address many design problems as they occur during the lifetime of an architectural design project, such as: design conceptualization, geometric modeling, structural consistency \& code checking, and many others \cite{Bayazit} \cite{bhatt-spatial-computing}. However, most research in this area unfortunately tends to focus on one aspect of space or the other but not both, i.e. quantitative but not qualitative or qualitative but not quantitative. For example, structural consistency \& code checking \cite{} involves the process of validating an architectural design against constraints on the quantitative geometric structures of the design, while design conceptualization involve modeling the basic spaces / zones of the architectural design from a qualitative perspective. 

%The tendency to focus on one aspect of space is especially true for state-of-the-art CAAD programs. This happens because CAAD programs provide an environment for architects to build a precise schematization of an architectural design with the purpose of using it as a blueprint during the design's realization. In essence, this means that there needs to be a direct and one-to-one correlation between the schematization of the design as defined by its representation of space and the design's physical manifestation in the real world. Consequently, CAAD programs represent the spatial features of a design, with respect to the individual elements that make up the design, from a perspective that captures its precise geometric form, i.e. the size, shape, location, and placement.

%This type of representation serves its purpose well (building a design in the real world) and can provides for some types of spatial reasoning over it, such as geometric reasoning (i.e. properties of angles, shapes, sizes, parallelism, etc.) and checking for higher level requirements, such as the load bearing capacity of building elements and structural integrity. However, the second form of reasoning requires additional knowledge (building materials and load barring properties) that go beyond the semantics of the design's spatial quantities. In this regard, the CAAD based representation makes it difficult to reason about aspects of the design from a conceptual level, i.e. the semantics that involve the design's function or purpose. The difficulty emerges in this regard because the conceptual aspects of a design define its abstract features while the CAAD based representation is grounded to a concrete and spatially general form that lacks the semantic at the conceptual level. In other words, there is a \emph{semantic gap} between the conceptual aspects of the design and it's CAAD based representation that is separated by the different levels of abstraction for each.

%This is where this thesis hopes to provide it contribution, by providing a framework that bridges the gap between a design's conceptualizations to it's precise geometric underpinnings.  

%construct a designs in a manner that directly corresponds to the realization of the design and therefore requires a precise representation of space. This type of representation needs to know about many aspects of a designs spatial features including the size, shape, dimensions, placement, and location of the individual elements that make up the building.   

%To make this possible, architectural designs are represented based on their structural form in a manner that captures its spatial properties precisely. This type of representation captures the design, in terms of the spatial features, spatial dimensions of architectural entities, placement of entities within the building, at a low-level of granularity that is needed in the actual construction of the building, and allows for reasoning about the physical, structural and mechanical aspects of a design with regard to the precise geometric representation; such as the placement of a door in a wall or the mechanics of a window swinging open and closed. TODO: talk about x,y,z coordinates of real space, quantitative representation.

%However, this type of representation scheme does not incorporation the qualitative and functional features of the design. For example, a structural design requirement that addresses air circulation stipulates that a doorway and window should face directly towards each other. For a traditional CAAD based system, reasoning about such a requirement is not possible because it pertains to qualitative spatial design features and functional attributes that go beyond the purely geometric representation of the design, i.e., in this case the qualitative spatial relationship between a window and doorway.




\chapter{Background and Related Works} 
%This chapter presents the background knowledge required for this thesis and the related works.  

\section{Background}
\label{background}
For this thesis there are two required areas of background knowledge: Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP).

\subsection{Qualitative Spatial Representation and Reasoning}
The field of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR) investigates techniques for representing and reasoning about abstract features of space in a computational framework while preserving its fundamental properties. In this regard, QSR represents space at a qualitative level as opposed to a quantitative level. At the qualitative level, space is defined by symbolic and abstract spatial relationships, such as \emph{behind}, \emph{left-of} and \emph{close-to}, while at the quantitative level, space is defined by precise numeric values \cite{freksa1991qsr} \cite{bhattSpatialComputing}. 

Qualitative representations of space can be quite useful. Take for example the task of describing the location of a chair to your friend. 
In order to effectively communicate the location of the chair, it is unnecessary to use precise numeric values that characterize the chair, such as its size, shape and weight, and metric spatial measurements that relate the chair to other objects, such as distance. Communicating qualitative spatial relationships, such as the orientation of the chair, is sufficient for effectively describing its location. An example could be, ``the chair is \emph{behind} the table and on the \emph{left-hand} side of the room''. By using qualitative relationships, you are representing space at a level of abstraction that hides away unnecessary details so that you are only dealing with those aspects of space that are important for the problem at hand.

While the example above is informal, formal qualitative representations of space preserve universal spatial aspects such as uniqueness (objects exist exactly once and each spatial location can have at most one object), and realizability (properties that related the compositional structures of spatial) while providing a computational apparatus to reason about space from an abstract level \cite{freksa1991qsr}. The following subsection will introduce several formal qualitative spatial representation calculi with respect to topology and orientation. 

%To solve this task it is unnecessary to have knowledge about the precise spatial characteristics of the room -- such as the size, shape, and weight of objects, metric measurements such as distance, etc. -- because the solution does not require an absolute location of the chair. Rather, a qualitative description of the room in terms of the orientational relationships between objects and the observer (\emph{left-of, righ-of, behind}) within the room should suffice. A specific qualitative description for this problem could be, the chair is \emph{left-of} the doorway and \emph{behind} the desk. This problem was solved from a qualitative spatial perspective by abstracting away the insignificant details and focusing on the aspects of space that are necessary for the problem domain. 

%As with any abstracting mechanism, QSR deals with high level abstractions by hiding away unnecessary details while preserving important domain specific aspects

%The advantages to QSR include reducing the search space of the spatial environment, using a higher level of abstraction that is closer to the conceptual representation of space that humans use...

\label{Qualitative Spatial Calculi}
\end{figure}

Formal qualitative spatial calculi are explicit characterizations of qualitative spatial relationships from a given perspective, i.e. topology, orientation, distance, etc., that logically define intrinsic spatial properties such as spatial uniqueness and spatial composition. Examples of qualitative spatial calculi that are important for this thesis include, the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) \cite{Randell92aspatial} for topological relationships, the Single Cross Calculus (SCC) for extrinsic orientational relationships \cite{Freksa92usingorientation} and Oriented Point Relation Algebra (OPRA) \cite{Moratz} for intrinsic orientational relationships.

RCC defines eight topological relationships over regions: disconnected, partial overlap, externally connected, equals, non-tangential proper part, inverse non-tangential proper part, tangential proper part, and inverse tangential proper part. Refer to figure \ref{RCC} for an illustration of these relationships. Axiomatic rules of jointly exhaustive, mutually disjoint and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) enforce the spatial uniques of each relationship \cite{Randell92aspatial}. For example, two regions can \emph{not} be partially overlapping and disconnected to each other at the same point in time. Additionally, composition tables define the set of realizable spatial arrangements for a collection of regions. For example, if region \emph{A} is inside region \emph{B} and region \emph{B} is inside region \emph{C}, then region \emph{A} must also be in region \emph{C}.

Orientational relationships can be broken down into intrinsic and extrinsic spatial relationships. Extrinsic relationships are defined by  an external reference point. This type of orientational relationship is characterized in the SCC, in which an external reference point is used to related two objects together. Figure \ref{SCC} illustrates the SCC partitioning of space for three points, \emph{A}, \emph{B}, and \emph{C}. In this example, \emph{C} is related to \emph{A} through \emph{B}, and has an \emph{L2} SCC relationship. 

Intrinsic relationships are defined by an internal perspective. This type of relationship is characterized in OPRA, in which the relationship of an external object is defined by the internal direction of the observing object. Figure \ref{OPRA} shows the relationship between two points, \emph{A} and \emph{B}. In this example point \emph{B} has an OPRA$_{2}$ relationship with \emph{A} of \emph{7} and point \emph{A} has an OPRA$_{2}$ relationship with \emph{B} of \emph{1}. 

As with RCC, axiomatic rules of JEPD and composition tables enforce spatial properties of uniqueness and composition for these two orientational calculi.

\subsection{Constraint Logic Programming}
Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) combines logic programing with constraint solving \cite{GavanelliCLP} \cite{WallaceCLP} \cite{Jaffar:1987:CLP}. Logic programming is based on a declarative semantic, in which programs are defined in terms of \emph{what} should be computed instead of \emph{how} programs should compute something (i.e. procedural style). In this regard, a logic programing language relies on built-in search and unification algorithms to solve logic based formula. At its essence, logic programming can be viewed as a basic form of constraint solving \cite{GavanelliCLP}. 

Prolog is one of the most well known and used logic programming languages. It is based on predicate logic, unification, logic conjunction, and depth-first search \cite{Sterling:1986}. From a constraint perspective, Prolog solves constraints over the set of uninterpreted structures, i.e. Prolog's unification algorithm works entirely on a syntactic level. What this means is that Prolog does not internally 
represent data beyond its syntax and can only unify terms based on this. Take for example the arithmetic expression 5 + 1 = 6. In Prolog this expression will fail because equality is true only on the syntactically level, i.e. 6 = 6.  

Constraint solving techniques can help logic programming by increasing the expressiveness of the language beyond the syntactic. In general, constraint solving is based on constraints, which are simply restrictions over a the values a set of variables can bind to. For specific constraint solvers, the variables and the constraints over the variables are based on a specific domain, such as arithmetic expressions, boolean logic, etc., which encode the semantics and unification algorithms for solving the logical formula directly in a logic based language. In the example above, an constraint solver for arithmetic expression would be able to resolve the expression 5 + 1 = 6 as true because it knows directly about the semantics of addition and equality. 

Building new constraint solvers is laborious because it typically requires \emph{hard-wired} the constraint solver into the complier or interpreter \cite{GavanelliCLP}. The use of Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) can help this process by providing a high level programming framework designed for the implementation and integrate constraint solvers into logic based languages. The aim is ease the process of building constraint solvers in terms of defining a new domain of constraints and integrating these constraints into a logic programming framework \cite{CHR}. CHR works by using logic based rules that rewrite constraints via simplification and propagation rules and constraints are solved by continually rewriting constraints until they are in a solvable form. Because these rules are based on logic themselves it integrates seamlessly into other logic based frameworks. 


\section{Related Works}
\label{related works}
There is a large body of research on tools for conceptual design assistance. The related works that will be discussed in this section have been narrowed to tools that provide assistance to a designer and use spatial reasoning as the basis of its design analysis.

%either reason about qualitative (i.e. experiential, spatial) or functional (i.e. noise insulation, energy conservation, smart home security) design aspects / requirements or evaluate a design utilizing spatial reasoning techniques. The last part of this section will discuss and summarize the different approaches in the context of the work that is being done in this thesis.

\subsection{Intelligent Critic System}
The intelligent computer-aided architectural design system (ICAAD) \cite{IntelligentCritic} is a tool that evaluates architectural floor plans based on government regulations and interior design guidelines. The research here focuses on  the spatial representation model for architectural design.

%The focus of this research is on how to representation spatial information in the context of architectural design requirement checking.

In this respect, ICAAD represents designs in an object oriented hierarchical model, which is grounded to architectural containment relationships, i.e. windows are contained by rooms, rooms are contained by apartments, and apartments are contained by buildings. Various architectural entities, such as rooms, windows and furniture are all represented individually as ICAAD objects in the hierarchical structure. Each ICAAD object is responsible for storing spatial data about the entity, including dimension, shape, and direction. Spatial relationships between entities, such as proximity and visibility, are extracted from the spatial ICAAD data and represented as a network that connects entities together based on spatial relationships. 

ICAAD uses Prolog's inference capabilities to match design rules (i.e., government regulations and interior deigns guidelines) against the ICAADs representation model. Violations are detected when a spatial relationship between entities are matched to a design requirement rule.


\subsection{The Architect's Collaborator}
The Architect's Collaborator (TAC) \cite{KoileTAC} is a design support system that evaluates architectural designs based on architectural qualities and provides recommendations to the designer with respect to these qualities. Within TAC, architectural qualities refer to experiential aspects of a design such as \emph{openness} and \emph{privacy}. The main contribution of TAC is that it evaluates designs based on architectural qualities and provides recommendations for improving the design.

%maps abstract qualities to measurable design features in order to rank designs based on adherence to a design quality and provide recommendations for improving the design. 

As an example, a designer might use TAC to evaluate a kitchen based on it being \emph{visibly open}. TAC evaluates this quality (visually open) based on a pre-defined spatial characteristic of the design. In this case, the percentage of this room (kitchen) that is visible from an adjacent room. A room is considered by TAC to be visibly open if the calculation is above a certain threshold. If it is below the threshold, TAC will provide recommendations to the designer to help increase the visual openness of the kitchen. 

%If the kitchen does not meet the goal of being visibly open, then TAC provides recommendations for improving the design. Recommendations are derived from a knowledge base that contains explanations for a goals failure, such as walls cause visual obstructions and decrease the visual openness between rooms. 

The main drawback to TAC is its use of `black box' spatial reasoning. From the example above, TAC directly maps the architectural quality of visual openness to a specific geometric characteristic of the design. This type of spatial reasoning if very specific to the definition of the problem, therefore making it difficult to expand upon. 

%measures the visible-openness of a room as the percentage of the room that is visible from another room. This definition of visible-openness uses a direct mapping between the high level conceptual requirement to the low level geometric properties of the design. 

\subsection{ICADS}
The Intelligent Computer-Aided Design System (ICADS) \cite{ICADS} is a collaborative design support tool that assists a designer by providing functional based analysis of a design. The tool provides analysis to a designer base on several different aspects, such as lighting, noise insulation, climate control, energy conservation, space layout, and construction costs. The focus of this research is on developing a series of knowledge based software agents that collaborate within ICADS to make recommendations to the user. 

\subsection{SEEDS}
The Software Environment for Supporting the Early Phases in Building Design (SEED) project \cite{SEEDS} is a framework that supports an architect during the entire architectural design process. Specific to the work done in this thesis, the SEED project introduced the idea of using constraints to represent design knowledge in order to automatically generate floor layouts. 

Within the SEED project, design knowledge is partitioned into two categories: design units and functional units. Design units represent the spatial and physical elements of a building. Functional units represent design requirements that constrain design units based on spatial attributes such as shape, size and placement, and non spatial attributes such as material make-up. 

Given a design, the SEED project tries to automatically generates possible floor plans that adhere to all of the design requirements, given a set of design and functional units. The main contribution of this work is that the system utilizes the constraint solving abilities in a CLP framework to autonomously find design layouts that meet the design's requirement specifications.


\subsection{Interior Design Configuration for a Virtual Environment}
Calderon \emph{et. al} \cite{} proposed a system that automatically configures an indoor virtual environment, with respect to the placement interior design elements, by specifying the design problem in terms of spatial constraints. The system works by solving constraint satisfaction problem as specified over the space of the virtual environment.

The spatial constraint problems are defined as follows: Given a virtual environment represented as a discrete Cartesian grid, a set of interior design objects (desks, chairs, lamps, etc.), and a set of spatial constraints over the design objects (i.e., a desk should be at least 4 meters from a power outlet), the system searches for viable locations for each object within the virtual environment such that all of the spatial constraints are satisfied. 

The contribution of this work lies in the use of spatial constraints for reasoning about virtual environment design. However, the work here is preliminary and has several shortcomings. To begin with, the virtual environment used in this system, is limited to a rectangular grid that is represented by discrete Cartesian coordinates. This means all spatial reasoning is over the discrete finite integer domain. Additionally, the expressiveness of the spatial constraints is limited. For example, topological relationships are define over rectangles and points with respect to the point being inside or outside the rectangle. No consideration is made for orientation, or objects with richer geometries than points and rectangles.

\subsection{Others}
The following research presents ideas that are similar to the work in this thesis, but differ from the primary works because they preliminary research.

Bhatt, et al. proposed a system in \cite{BhattDH09} that validates a designer's conceptual requirements against an architectural design in the context of Smart Homes. The system reasons about design from a structural and functional perspective.   

Key proposes a descriptor language that defines architectural qualities from a computational perspective \cite{Key}. The work here is quite similar to the work in this thesis with regards to the approach that architectural qualities emerge from the precise geometric configurations of design elements and that these qualities can be discovered by spatial interpretation. The language defines architectural descriptor for concepts such as enclosure, continuity, and spaciousness and does so by interpreting the descriptor in terms of spatial properties. However, the approach here lacks the integration of qualitative spatial representation and reasoning as an intermediate layer between the high level concepts and low level geometries and instead uses a more direct approach to geometric and spatial reasoning.

Borrmann introduces the idea of including predefined spatial constraints directly into a standard building production model, i.e., Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), to detect constraint violations \cite{Borrmann}. This proposal primarily focuses on the definition and integration of spatial constraints into the IFC model but it does provide some discussion on how these spatial constraints might be checked for in such an environment. While similar to CRR, this proposals approach is focused on the integration of spatial constraints into a specific building model (IFC) format and does not go into the process of generating the spatial constraints from the geometric configurations of a design. 

\subsection{Discussion}
Table \ref{related works table} shows the high level objectives of each tool that was discussed in this section. This includes requirements checking, design evaluation, and automatic floor plan configuration. Despite the differences, each system provides design assistance at a conceptual level.

%the systems are all bound by a higher objective to provide computational assistance to an architect during the design process and specifically, in the context of conceptual design formalization and reasoning.

\end{table}   

Out of this group the ICAAD tool is the most similar to the CRR. Both systems provide a framework for checking design requirements using qualitative spatial relations. Despite the similarities, there are many differences. ICAADS focuses on the spatial representation model for architectural designs in the context of requirement reasoning and gives little attention or discussion to the underlying techniques for spatial reasoning and spatial abstraction. While the ICAAD approach allows the system to reason automatically over the entire design, it does so by relying on the underlying 'black box' spatial reasoning. Extending 'black box' reasoning can be quite difficult because spatial functions are built only to solve a specific problem. On the other hand, the CRR uses general qualitative spatial reasoning and formal spatial calculi to reason over architectural designs. The advantages to this approach is that the reasoner is extensible, i.e., it is easy to build new design requirements by using the existing services of the spatial reasoners.  

%s based on formal qualitative spatial calculi (\cite{scc} \cite{opra} \cite{topolog}), formalization and spatial interpretation of architectural concepts (i.e. experiential and spatial qualities found in architecture), and the abstraction of CAAD based geometric representations into the qualitative spatial domain.

Table \ref{functionality table} shows the different functionality between the related works discussed above. This includes whether of not the tool supports reasoning about experiential qualities (openness, privacy), functional aspects (cost, noise insulation, security), and artifactual extension (operational / functional space), if the tool incorporates spatial representation and reasoning techniques and formal qualitative spatial calculi, if the system provide the user with feedback or recommendations based on design analysis, and if the system uses constraint based reasoning.

  }
  \end{center}
\caption{Functionality}
\label{functionality table}
\end{table} 

The CRR provides most of the functionality of the other systems expect it does not provide feedback to the user and it does not evaluate a design based on metrics. The indention for this version of CRR is to provide a solid framework for spatial reasoning over architectural designs and requirement reasoning. Future version of the tool might incorporate these aspects. 

Table \ref{spatial table} shows the spatial reasoning capabilities for each system. It includes spatial reasoning for topological relationships, orientation (intrinsic and extrinsic), distance, and metric. Metric relationships refer to quantitative geometric functions such as the calculation of length or area.

   \end{tabular}
  }
  \end{center}
\caption{Spatial Reasoning}
\label{spatial table}
\end{table}

The CRR is the only tool in the group which provides support for every type of spatial reasoning. Additionally, it is the only system that does so using formal qualitative spatial reasoning and representation techniques. This is one of the main advantages of the CRR. Using a broad variety of of spatial relationships (topological, orientational, distance, metric) the CRR provides flexibility and a rich set of spatial relationships to build design requirements. This is important because the spatial configurations that make up a building are complex and need flexibility in terms of the way they are characterized and reasoned over. 


\chapter{Conceptual Requirements Reasoner}
The CRR is a framework for validating conceptual design requirements against CAAD based architectural design plans. Conceptual design requirements here refer to requirements as they pertain to the functional and experiential aspects of the design from a semantic and qualitative perspective. For example, architects commonly describe aspects of a design in a qualitative fashion, such as a design being private, accessible, or continuous. These architectural aspects emerge from the spatial structures / arrangements of the building form and are experienced in the building. 

The goal of the CRR is to build a computational framework that represents and reasons about design requirements in the context of conceptual design requirement validation.     

\section{Design Problem}
The field of Spatial Computing for Architectural Design \cite{bhatt-spatial-computing} investigates the computation apparatus that is necessary to represent and reasoning about architectural form and function from multiple levels of abstraction: \emph{conceptual}, \emph{qualitative}, and \emph{quantitative}. At the conceptual level the architect perceives the design at a high level of abstraction. For example, at this level the architect would think in terms of spaciousness, privacy, continuity, and visibility. At the quantitative level the architect engages the design at a low level of abstraction. Now the architect considers concrete, physical aspects of the design. These include the geometric shape and spacial location of the design's structural form. These levels of abstraction are referred to in this thesis as the architectural design hierarchy, where the top of the hierarchy corresponds to the conceptual, the middle corresponds to the qualitative, and the bottom corresponds to the quantitative. 

%These levels are connected to each other because conceptual features at the top level emerge from spatial design patterns at the bottom level. 

%The semantics at the conceptual level included architectural concepts such as continuity, enclosure, privacy, and visibility, and spatial qualities of orientation, positioning, and proximity, while the semantics at the quantitative level involve general spatial primitives of polygons, lines, and points. The semantics of the qualitative level, the intermediating layer, involve qualitative spatial relationships. 

Applying the architectural concept of spaciousness to the architectural design hierarchy to will show how high level concepts are connected to low level spatial quantities. In this example, the concept of spaciousness conveys an experiential quality of the design such as the feeling of openness. Such an experiential quality emerges from of the spatial design patterns of the building's physical form. In other words, the location and placement of architectural entities such as walls, ceilings, windows, and doors, and their spatial relationships as they define the size and shape of rooms and spaces, directly affect the experiential quality of openness. In general, changes in the spatial patterns at the quantitative level affect the experiential qualities of the design at the conceptual level. Figure \ref{multi-perspective-reps} illustrates this concept in which the features of the design at the conceptual level emerges from its spatial environment at the quantitative level via spatial patterns on the qualitative level.

\end{figure}

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art CAAD programs \cite{ArchiCAD} \cite{AutoCAD} do not support the representation of and reasoning about architectural design at a conceptual level. This happens because the CAAD-based design representation model is encapsulated at the quantitative level of the architectural design hierarchy, which lacks the semantics necessary for representation and reasoning at higher levels of abstraction. 

While this model is well suited for certain design tasks, such as the building of an accurate blueprint of the design, it does not support other architectural design processes that require reasoning at a higher level of abstraction. These include design conceptualization, requirements reasoning and functional specification, to name a few \cite{bhatt-spatial-computing}. 

Take for example the tasks an architect might face during the design conceptualization phase of a museum, including, among other things, defining high level functional and aesthetic requirements of the museum's design. The following descriptions of the \emph{Museu Calouste Gulbenkian} in Lisbon, Portugal exemplifies this phase:
\begin{quote}
\emph{``The current topographic conditions of the site, where the larger trees are located in an area that is more elevated than the whole northern rim of the plot, made it possible to install a huge underground floor in the already existing depression, whose covering creates a gentle artificial elevation that perspectively accentuates and enhances the whole architectural composition. The distribution of the construction volumes fundamentally followed a desire for horizontality, allowing one to read the continuity of the green space beyond the construction and in all directions.''}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\emph{``This sober, rational and markedly horizontal structure is distinctive for its laminar exterior, its modular repetition, austere design and the hard quality of the materials which shape it, concrete and glass.''}
\end{quote}
Environmental aspects of the museum's design, such as these expressed in the above descriptions, encompass high level spatial design patterns that are identified at the design conceptualization phase. Because CAAD-based systems do not represent the design semantics at a level of abstraction that is required to express these conceptualization, it is therefore incapable of providing the designer with assistance during this phase of the design process.

Design reasoning at a conceptual level, such as the example above, requires the underlying model representation semantics at the same level of abstraction. In this regard, the design semantics at the conceptual level involve abstractions over architectural entities such as rooms, floors, buildings, doors, and walls, along with the relationships they share between each other, both spatially, facing, near-to, across-from, connected-to, and non-spatially, material composition, lighting attributes, and load bearing qualities. Conversely, the underlying model representation semantics of CAAD-based system are based on spatially general and low level geometric primitives of points, lines, and polygons that lack the notions at the higher levels of the architectural design hierarchy. Where as an architect might conceptualize the design of a museum in terms such as galleries and the relative placement of objects within each gallery, e.g., ``the statue is on the \emph{left-hand-side} of the gallery as one enters from the main doors'', the process of building the museum in a CAAD-based tool restricts the architect to using points, lines and polygons. 

The \emph{semantic gap} exemplified between the conceptual and quantitative levels of the architectural design hierarchy is the crux of the problem being addressed in this thesis. The following section introduces the scope of this thesis by narrowing the focus of the thesis to conceptual requirements reasoning, it outlines the approaches taken towards this goal, and presents the thesis's main contributions. 

%The design semantics at the quantitative level do not represent the design at a level of abstraction that is need to reason at a conceptual level.

%For example, it is possible to reason about the geometric properties of a design in terms of the size, shape, and location of architectural entities given the CAAD-based representation semantics of space. At this level of reasoning, the reasoner and the underlying representational model are both ground to the same level of abstraction, namely the quantitative semantics of polygon, lines and points. 

%Unfortunately, reasoning at more abstract levels, involving conceptual design semantics such as visibility, continuity, and enclosure, or spatial qualities such as facing, across-from, and near-to, breaks down because there is a \emph{semantic gap} between the levels of abstraction of the reasoning queries with the underlying representation.



\section{Scope and Contributions}
The objective of this thesis is an initial step towards building a framework that bridges the gap between a design's conceptual features to its real world quantitative representation (i.e., CAAD-based model). Specifically, the framework, referred to as the Conceptual Requirements Reasoner or CRR, does this in the context of conceptual requirements validation. Conceptual requirements validation involves checking that the underlying spatial structures of a design, in the quantitative representation, are consistent with its conceptual features as they are specified by a architect. Towards this goal the following objectives have been identified as crucial:
\begin{itemize}
\item the identification, formal modeling, and spatial interpretation of architectural concepts
\item the spatial abstraction and qualification of CAAD-based quantitative models, and
\item the use of qualitative spatial representation and reasoning techniques to connect high level concepts to low level spatial quantities  
\end{itemize}

To address these objectives, this thesis follows the approach introduced by Bhatt and Freksa \cite{bhatt-spatial-computing}, with regards to Spatial Computing for Architectural Design. This thesis does so by following the design space hierarchy as illustrated in Figure \ref{multi-perspective-reps}, in implementing a framework for validating conceptual requirements against a work-in-progress design. The main contributions in this respect are identified here:
\begin{itemize}
\item the implementation of a framework that validates conceptual design requirements against a CAAD-based design representation model
\item the development of a multi-hierarchy that maps architectural concepts at the conceptual level to spatial patterns in the qualitative level
\item the implementation of spatial constraint solvers for the qualification of CAAD-based quantitative models
\end{itemize}

The following section introduces the high level design and implementation of the CRR with regards to the scope and contributions identified in this section.

%The main problem being addressed in this thesis is how to validate conceptual design requirements in a practical design workflow involving a CAAD based design representation. As discussed in the previous section, designs are represented quantitatively in CAAD based systems using spatial primitives of point, lines, and polygons that do not incorporate the semantics needed for reasoning at higher levels of abstraction, such as conceptual requirements validation. 

%Given the need to bridge the gap between the conceptual and the quantitative levels of the design hierarchy in this context the following issues have been identified as crucial:

%focuses on supporting a designer by validating conceptual requirements against a work-in-progress design from a CAAD-based system. The framework built for this thesis is referred to as the Conceptual Requirements Reasoner or CRR.
     
      
%This representation allows an architect to validate a work-in-progress design from a conceptual and qualitative perspective against the physical and precise real world geometrical representation of the design \cite{Bhatt}.

%The crux of this is that it bridges the gap between the quantified geometries and the functional / qualitative requirements of the design, thus allowing the reasoner to validate a high level requirement against its precise geometric representation. 


\section{Design and Approach}
The design and implementation of the CRR is based on the design hierarchy as illustrated in Figure \ref{hierarchy no-links}, in which the problem space for conceptual requirements reasoning is broken down into a design space, quality space, and quantitative space. The highest level of the hierarchy, the design space, represents the design concepts and architectural spatial qualities that describe the design from a experiential perspective. In this level of the hierarchy, design concepts are characterized based on architectural spatial qualities. For example, the concept of privacy in an architectural context, is characterized based on the architectural spatial qualities of facing, positioning and visibility. The middle level of the hierarchy, the quality space, represents the design based on qualitative spatial relationships of orientation, topology and distance. Qualitative spatial relationships, in the CRR, are defined using formal qualitative spatial calculi such as the Region Connection Calculus for topological relationships, the Single Cross Calculus for extrinsic orientational relationships and the Oriented Point Relational Algebra for intrinsic orientational relationships. The lowest level of the hierarchy, the quantity space, represents the design in terms of its precise spatial geometries. This representation is similar to what is represented in a CAAD-based system.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=140mm]{spatial-qualities-hierarchy-nolinks}
\caption{Design Space Multi-Hierarchy}
\label{hierarchy no-links}
\end{figure}

Given the three hierarchical levels of the design space, the main issue now becomes how each level is connected to and interfaces with each other. In other words, how do concepts in the design space relate to qualitative spatial relationships in the quality space, and similarly, how do qualitative spatial relationships in the quality space relate to geometric objects in the quantity space. At the core of this is the qualitative spatial level, an intermediary layer that interfaces between the highest and lowest levels of the design hierarchy. 

The conceptual and qualitative levels of the design hierarchy are connected through an individual mapping of each concept and spatial quality to qualitative spatial design patterns. In other words, concepts in the design space are explicitly defined based on the spatial relationships at the qualitative level. Take for example the architectural spatial quality of positioning, where objects can be spatially situated at the same or opposing sides of a room. The positioning quality is defined in the CRR based on extrinsic orientational spatial patterns as interpreted by an architect. Chapter \ref{conceptual requirements} will go into further detail regarding the specific spatial interpretation and characterization of each concept and spatial quality as identified in the thesis.

%One interpretation of this quality is based on extrinsic orientational spatial patterns that are based on qualitative spatial relationships. In this case, the orientational relationships of the structural form define the design's positioning qualities. 

%The concepts and spatial qualities in the design space are connected to qualitative spatial relationships in the qualitative space through a process of spatially interpreting and characterizing design concepts and spatial qualities individually.
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=140mm]{spatial-qualities-hierarchy}
\caption{Design Space Multi-Hierarchy}
\label{hierarchy}
\end{figure}

The geometric quantities in the quantitative level are connected to the qualitative spatial relationships in the qualitative level through spatial abstraction and qualification. This process involves abstracting the quantitative geometries of the design to abstract spatial objects that can be used for qualification of spatial relationships. Chapter \ref{representation and reasoning}  will go into the details regarding the CRR's underlying spatial representation structure at the quantitative level and the spatial reasoning necessary to spatially abstract and qualify the quantitative representation.  

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=100mm]{design}
\caption{CRR Design Implementation}
\label{crr design implementation}
\end{figure}

The implementation of the CRR is broken down into three modules as specified in the design hierarchy, and is illustrated in Figure \ref{crr design implementation}. The top level module is where architectural concepts and spatial qualities are defined in terms of qualitative spatial patterns and is the interface through which  users will query the CRR. The quantitative space module represents the design's precise geometries as defined in a CAAD-based system. The data at this level is imported from a multi-modal access framework \cite{carl} based on the IFC standard for CAAD-based systems. The qualitative space module is responsible for the spatial abstraction and qualification of the quantitative model and is implemented as a series of spatial constraint solvers for topological, orientational, and distance reasoning. 




From a user perspective, the CRR provides a designer with design assistance for a work-in-progress design. The CRR does this through a query engine that allows a designer to validate conceptual requirements. For example, a designer is provided with a set of architectural concepts and spatial qualities, which the designer uses to construct queries to the CRR. For example if a designer wants to check if a door and window are facing each other (as might be a requirement for air circulation purposes) the designer can simply makes the following query to the CRR:
\begin{verbatim}
    ?- facing(door, window).
\end{verbatim} The CRR will respond to the query with a \emph{true} if the door and window are facing each other and a \emph{fail} if they are not.

%The design multi-hierarchy developed in this section is built on the mapping of the design problem into a design space, a quality space, and a quantity space. At the highest level, the design space involves the architectural design semantics (architectural concepts) and qualities (qualitative spatial attributes found in architecture) that emerge in architecture. At the lowest level, the quantitative space involves the precise geometries of the architectural structures found in the design. The qualitative space mediates between the abstractions of the design layer and the concreteness of the quantitative later using qualitative spatial representation and reasoning.

%Figure \ref{hierarchy} shows the design multi-hierarchy used in the DSpace reasoner. Conceptual design requirements are built from the architectural concepts and qualitative spatial attributes found in architecture (QSA) of the highest level of the multi-hierarchy. Within the multi-hierarchy, architectural concepts are built using QSA, but are not limited to only these, spatial relationships of orientation, topology, and distance can be used, as well as other geometric primitives such as area, angle, and length measurements. QSA are defined by the qualitative spatial relationships of orientation, topology, and distance. These qualitative spatial relationships emerge from the quantitative, physical, and artefactual geometries of the the design. TBD: physical structures define the way the architecture is experiences and influences the functional / performance of the design from a conceptual design perspective. 

%Prolog facts make up a factbase that stores a table of architectural entities with their architectural types (e.g., wall, door, window, desk, etc.). Each architectural entity in the design has a single entry in the factbase. The factbase is instantiated automatically during the import process from a CAAD based representation. This factbase will be used throughout the DSpace reasoner to  verify an entity exists in the design and links it to its architectural type. The following Prolog code shows two instantiated facts (predicates) for a doorway, and a window. 


\chapter{Design Representation and Spatial Reasoning} \label{representation and reasoning}
This chapter introduces the computational framework of the CRR. It presents two of the three components of the framework: 1) the internal architectural design representation structure and 2) the spatial constraint solvers. The third component  of the CRR, the conceptual requirements component, will be presented in the following Chapter. Additionally, this chapter presents each component in the context of the declarative programming paradigm used for the implementation of the CRR, namely Prolog and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). 

This chapter is organized into two sections. The first section looks at the internal architectural design representation structure and how it is implemented in Prolog. The second section looks at the spatial constraint solvers and how each is implemented in CLP.

\section{Design Representation}
The CRR internally represents two distinct aspects of an architectural design. It represents the design's physical form and non-physical artefactual extensions. The physical form pertains to the precise geometric data that defines the design's structural elements (walls, doors, windows, slabs, stairs, columns, etc.) with regard to layout, location and shape. Artefactual extension pertains to the non-physical but geometric data that defines the functional characteristics of structural elements, such as the space used by a person to operate a doorway.

The physical representation of the design is automatically imported into the CRR from a multi-modal spatial data access framework \cite{MultiModal} built by the DesignSpace project \cite{DesignSpace}. For each architectural entity, the CRR imports the structural geometric coordinate data and a unique identifier, referred to in the CRR as the \emph{crr\_id}. Currently, artefactual extensions are manually imported in the CRR, but the intent for future versions is to automate this directly from the multi-modal spatial data access framework.  

The remainder of this section is broken up into three subsections. The first subsection looks at the physical representation structure. The second subsection looks at the artefactual representation structure. The final subsection looks at how each are implemented in the CRR.

\subsection{Physical Design Representation}
The physical representation of a design models its' structural form in terms of precise physical geometric features (i.e., layout, shape, location). Architectural entities, such as walls, windows, doorways, columns, and rooms, are represented in the CRR as geometric primitives of polygons, lines and points that correspond to the physical dimensions (length, width, shape) of the entities as they occur in the real world. The physical representation of the design is analogous to the design perspective that is represented by CAAD programs. 


\subsection{Artefactual Design Representation}
An artefactual extension is a non-physical, spatial extension of an architectural entity that pertain to a specific functional quality. While artefactual extension does not have a physical manifestation, it is an important aspect of the design representation model because it affects the functionality and performance of a design from an experiential perspective. 

There are three types of spatial artefacts identified by Bhatt\cite{Bhatt} that are represented in the CRR: \emph{operational space}, \emph{functional space}, and \emph{range space}.

% \caption{Artefactual Extensions}
%\label{artefactual-extensions}
%\end{figure}

The operational space encompasses the region of space required by an object to preform its function. For example, the operational space of a door is the area in which a door can occupy during its operation, opening and closing (see figure \ref{operational-space}). This space is dynamic in the sense that it represents the configurable space of the physical doorway. 

The functional space encompasses the region of space that is required for an object to function itself or the space for a person to operate an object. For example, the functional space of a doorway is the total area needed for a person to operate, open and close, as well as any additional space need to navigate entirely through the doorway (see figure \ref{functional-space}). 

The range space pertains to a region of space that encompass the range of a sensor (i.e., camera, motion sensor). For example, the range space of a camera is defined by its depth of field and angle of view. It represents the total space that is under surveillance of the camera (see figure \ref{range-space}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=50mm]{door-sink}
\caption{Operational Space Interference}
\label{door-sink}
\end{figure}

Artefactual extensions directly affect the experiential quality of a design. For example, a sink in a bathroom has a functional space, the space a person occupies while washing his/her hands at the sink. If this space interferes with (i.e., topologically overlapping) the functional and/or physical space of a doorway, this will cause a circulation problem when both the doorway and sink are simultaneously being operated, i.e., a collision between the person washing his/her hands and the doorway itself or the person operating the doorway. In this example, the functional aspects of the bathrooms design with regard to the mitigation of circulation problems is directly influenced by the spatial configuration of the non-physical artefactual extensions of the design. It should be noted that this type of occurrence can not be modeled in current CAAD program because they do not have a way to represent artefactual extension.


\subsection{Implementation}
Within the CLP framework of the CRR, the physical and artefactual design representation model is implemented as several factbases and rulebases. There are two factbases that can be described as in memory database-like structures. The first factbase is used as a catalog, which relates each architectural entity to it's architectural type (wall, window, door, room, interior design object, etc.) via its \emph{crr\_id}. Each entry in the factbase is a Prolog predicate of the form $architectural \mathunderscore type(crr \mathunderscore id, type)$.
\begin{verbatim}
   architectural_type(door42, door).
   architectural_type(wall49, wall).
\end{verbatim} The second factbase is used as a linking table that relates two architectural entities based on structural containment relationships, i.e. door42 is contained by wall5, wall5 in contained by room6. Each containment relationship is implemented as a Prolog predicate of the form $contained(contained \mathunderscore crr \mathunderscore id, containing \mathunderscore crr \mathunderscore id)$.
\begin{verbatim}
   contained(door42, wall5).
   contained(wall5, room3).
\end{verbatim} 

Rulebases link architectural entities to geometric representations, and each representation, physical, functional, operational, and range, has a separate rulebase. However, they are all implemented using a similar form. Each rulebase is comprised as a series of Prolog rules each with a head and a body. The head links an entity to a variable that represents its' geometric structure. The body of each rule is responsible for transforming coordinate point data (from import) into internally defined spatial primitives of points, lines, and polygons. The following rules show the physical, functional and operational rules for a door with a \emph{crr\_id} of door42. Note the similarities and differences between rules.
\begin{verbatim}
    physical_representation(door42, Geometry) :-
            spatial_primitive(Geometry, [(1,3),(1,4),(4,4),(4,3)]).
            
    functional_representation(door42, FuncGeometry) :-
            spatial_primitive(FuncGeometry, [(1,7),(4,7),(1,1),(4,1)]).
            
    operational_representation(door42, OpGeometry) :-
            spatial_primitive(OpGeometry, [(1,4),(4,6),(4,3)]).
\end{verbatim} 

The $spatial \mathunderscore primitive$ rule transforms coordinate data into spatial primitives and binds a variable (its' second argument) to the spatial primitive representation. The $spatial \mathunderscore primitive$ rule works by matching arguments. For example, the following call to the $spatial \mathunderscore primitive$ rule with a single point in the second argument instantiates the the variable, \emph{SpatialPrimitive}, as a point object primitive.
\begin{verbatim}
   spatial_primitive(SpatialPrimitive, (5,7)).
\end{verbatim} Similarly, a call to $spatial \mathunderscore primitive$ with a list of points instantiates the variable as a polygon object primitive.
\begin{verbatim}
   spatial_primitive(SpatialPrimitive, [(5,7), (5,9), (7,7)]).
\end{verbatim} 

Every architectural entity has a physical representation but may or may not have a functional, operational, or range representation. For example, a doorway usually has a functional and operational representation but may not have a range representation. Some entities, such as columns, have no artefactual representations. However, there is no limitation to which entities can or can not have certain artefactual extensions.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=120mm]{clp-design}
\caption{Representation in CLP}
\label{clp-design}
\end{figure}

Factbases and rulebases can be queried using a Prolog interpretor. A call to the $architectural \mathunderscore type$ factbase can be used to get an entity's type given its' \emph{crr\_id}, such as the following query.
\begin{verbatim}
    architectural_type(door42, Type).
\end{verbatim} The return of this call instantiates the Type variable with the door's type, which is \emph{door}. Similarly, a query to a rulebase will return and instantiated variable with the respective spatial representations. Figure \ref{clp-design} shows the implementation structure for the rulebases. For example, a query to the \emph{physical\_representation} rulebase will instantiate the $Geometry$ variable with a physical representation. \begin{verbatim}
    physical_representation(door42, Geometry).
\end{verbatim} Calls to the functional, operational, and range representation rulebases work in the exact same fashion.


%Given an entity and its \emph{crr\_id}, a query to the DSpace rulebase will return an instantiated variable with the entity's quantitative geometry.  
%If the following query is made, the quantitative geometry of \emph{window445} will be instantiated in the \emph{Geometry} variable.

%Within the DSpace CLP framework, the quantitative geometry is defined by geometric primitives of polygons, lines, and points. These primitives are defined by Prolog rules that consume quantitative point data and return an instantiated spatial primitive. The following Prolog rules shows an example of a quantitative rule definition for an entity with \emph{crr\_id window445}. This rule will be stored in the DSpace rulebase. 

%Within the DSpace CLP framework, artefactual geometries are defined using the same spatial primitives as the quantitative geometries. The main difference between the two is that there are multiple rules, one for each artefactual type: functional, operational, and range. An entity may have zero or more artefactual geometries. For example, a doorway in general has a functional and operational representation but does not have one for range representation, while a column has no artefactual representations. The following Prolog rules show and example of a rule definition for the functional and operational representations for a doorway with \emph{crr\_id} of \emph{door55}. 

%Given an entity and its crr\_id, a query to the DSpace rulebase will return an instantiated variable with the entity’s artefactual geometry. Which geometry is returned is based on the rule that is queried. If the following functional representation query is made, the functional geometry of \emph{door55} will be instantiated in the FuncGeometry variable.
%\begin{verbatim}
 %  functional_geometry(door55, FuncGeometry).
%\end{verbatim}

%the multiple perspective model is implemented as a set of Prolog rules. These rules bind architectural entities, via their DSpace identifier (\emph{crr\_id}), to their physical and functional representations. Combining these rules for each entity creates a rulebase that stores each representation in the DSpace CLP framework. This rulebase can be queried to retrieve a specific geometric representation given a \emph{crr\_id}. Figure \ref{clp-design} shows the implementation design for the multiple representation structure in the DSpace CLP framework. Notice that all rules are accessed via the factbase, which stores \emph{crr\_id}'s and ensures that an entity exists before the rulebase is queried. Additionally, all representations are defined over the same set of spatial primitives. This uniformity will be an important aspect of the spatial reasoner in the next section. 


\section{Spatial Reasoning}
Qualitative spatial representation and reasoning is used in the CRR to bridge the gap between a design's high level conceptual requirements and its' low level geometric representation. This process begins by spatially abstracting the design's (quantitative) geometric representation into spatially abstract (qualitative) objects and are used by the constraint solvers to qualify topological, orientational, and distance relationship over the design, as is illustrated in Figure \ref{reasoner-design}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=110mm]{reasoner-design}
\caption{Quality Space}
\label{reasoner-design}
\end{figure}
% house image from http://www.tinyhomes.com/TH2163_SimpleElegance.html

The spatial constraint solvers uses formal qualitative spatial calculi for topological (Region Connected Calculus \cite{Freksa}), orientational (Single Cross \cite{Freksa}, Oriented Point Relation Algebra \cite{Moratz}) and distance to qualitatively represent and reason over the design. Within the CLP framework of the CRR, the spatial constraint solvers are implemented in CLP($\mathbb{R}$) (CLP over Reals) and Constrain Handling Rules (CHR). The topological and distance constraint solvers extend Sindalog \cite{Sindalog}, a spatial constraint solver written in CHR.

Within the CRR, each spatial constraint solver can be used as a query engine that qualifies spatial relationships to answer spatial queries.  A spatial query involves three step:
\begin{enumerate}
\item retrieval of quantitative representation 
\item spatial abstraction of quantitative representation
\item qualification via constraint solving
\end{enumerate}  
As an example, the following query involves the inside topological relationship between a desk and a room. 
\begin{verbatim}
   inside(desk3, room1).
\end{verbatim} In the first step, the quantitative geometries of the desk and room are retrieved from the physical representation rulebase. The second step uses transformation rules (as will be discussed in the next section) to spatially abstract these geometries into abstract spatial objects. Finally, the spatially abstracted objects are used by the topological constraint solver to qualify the inside relationship. The constraint solver will respond \emph{true} if the desk has an inside spatial relationship with the room, and \emph{fail} if it does not.   

%The spatial constraint solvers work directly over the design representation structure via the spatial abstraction representation layer and the design factbase. The main service of the reasoner is qualification of the quantitative architectural space into the qualitative feature space of topology, orientation, and distance. It should be noted that the distance constraint solver is different from the topological and orientational constraint solvers because it does not qualify distance relationships, rather it solves minimum distance constraints over quantitative objects. The topological and distance constraint solvers extend The Sindalog spatial constraint solver \cite{Sindalong}, a spatial constraint solver written in CHR. These qualitative spatial relationships are, in turn, used to reason about conceptual design requirements.

The remainder of this section is structured as follow. The first subsection looks at how the quantitative representation of entities in a design are spatially abstracted. The second, third and forth subsections look at topological, orientational and distance based reasoning respectively.

\subsection{Spatial Abstraction}
Spatial abstraction is the process of generalizing a precise spatial representation so as to represent only those features that are necessary for qualitative spatial reasoning. Within the context of the CRR, quantitative representations (physical and aretefactual) are abstracted to points, directed points and convex hulls in order to reason about the design's qualitative spatial relationships of topology, orientation and distance. For example, one approach to reasoning about the qualitative orientational relationship between two doors requires that both doors are spatially represented as directed points. Because doors are naturally represented as polygons, spatial abstraction is needed to transform their quantitative polygonal representation into a qualitative directed point representation.

%In DSpace architectural entities can be spatially abstracted. This allows DSpace to reason about a design from a qualitative level of abstraction with regards to its spatial characteristics of topology, orientation and distance. This type of qualitative spatial reasoning reasons over the abstract feature space of the design using abstract spatial objects of points, directed points, and convex hulls. 

%Architectural entities are not directly modeled as abstract spatial objects. These objects are generated by transformation rules that abstract the quantitative geometries of the architectural entities. 

The process of spatially abstracting an architectural entity depends on the following:
\begin{enumerate} \label{abs dependencies}
\item the type of spatial abstraction, eg. line to point, polygon to convex hull
\item an interpretation of the intrinsic nature of an entity within an architectural and design context
\end{enumerate}
For example, the abstracted representation of a doorway as a directed point is not only defined by its physical form (a polygon) but also by the interpretation of the doorway's intrinsic direction in the context of its' situation in the design. Further discussion on this topic can be found in \ref{spatial abstraction}.

Within the CLP framework of the CRR, architectural entities are spatial abstracted using Prolog rules. These rules transform an entity's quantitative representation into objects of points, directed points and convex hulls. Transformation rules take an \emph{crr\_id}, retrieve the quantitative geometry and preform a series of geometric transformations based on the dependencies discussed earlier in this section. As an example, the rule for spatially abstracting a door represented as polygon into a point first retrieves the physical polygonal representation and transforms the polygon into a point by calculating the polygons centroid. 
\begin{verbatim}
    point_abstraction(crr_id, PtAbs) :-
           physical_representation(crr_id, Polygon),
           centroid(Polygon, PtAbs).
\end{verbatim} Given an crr\_id, a query to abstraction rule will return an instantiated variable with the entity's spatially abstracted geometry. For example, if the following query to the point abstraction rule is made for a doorway with \emph{crr\_id} of \emph{door42}, then the point abstraction geometry of \emph{door42} will be instantiated in the PtAbs variable.
\begin{verbatim}
    point_abstraction(door55, PtAbs).
\end{verbatim}

%Spatially abstracting an architectural entity depends on the entity type, the spatial abstraction type (point, directed point, or convex hull) and sometimes a contextual identifier (direction of a doorway into or out of a specific room). Given these dependencies, spatially abstraction rules geometrically transform the quantitative geometries into abstract spatial objects. 

%Unlike the quantitative and functional representations, the abstract representation is not stored in the rulebase. Rather, spatial abstraction rules function over the quantitative and functional rulebase. For example, the spatial abstraction rule for a doorway into a point abstraction requires the point abstraction rule to query the quantitative rulebase to retrieve the doorways quantitative geometry. The following spatial abstraction rule is for a doorway point abstraction. Note that the rule is based on the interpretation of a doorway point abstraction as the centroid of its quantitative geometry (see Appendix A.1).   



\subsection{Topology}
The CRR can qualify four topological relationships for convex hulls: inside (\ref{inside}), outside (\ref{outside}), partially overlapping (\ref{overlapping}), and disconnected (\ref{disconnected}). 
%In the CRR, topological qualification uses geometric properties of convex hulls to detect topological relationships. 

\begin{figure}[b]
 \centering
 \subfloat[inside]{\label{inside}\includegraphics[width=27mm]{ntpp}}
 \hspace{4 mm}

  \hspace{4 mm}

 \hspace{2 mm}
 \subfloat[disconnected]{\label{disconnected}\includegraphics[width=43mm]{disconnected}}
 \caption{Topological Relationships}
\label{topoloy}
\end{figure}

An object \emph{A} has an inside relationship with an object \emph{B} if all \emph{A}'s points are inside the convex hull of \emph{B}. The inside relationship is qualified by checking the property of convex hull to point containment. A point in \emph{A} is contained inside the convex hull of \emph{B} if the polarity of the determinate between a point in \emph{A} and each line segment in \emph{B} is negative [need citation]. In the CRR, points in a convex hull are always ordered counterclockwise, therefore the polarity of the determinant between a point inside the convex hull will always be negative. 

An object \emph{A} has an outside relationship with an object \emph{B} if all \emph{B}'s points are inside the convex hull of \emph{A}. Because the outside relationship is the inverse of the inside relation it is easy to qualify in DSpace by using the inside relationship ($inside(B,A)$). 

An object \emph{A} has a partially overlapping relationship with an object \emph{B} if one or more line segments in \emph{A} intersect with one or more line segments in \emph{B}. The partially overlapping relationship is qualified in DSpace by checking for line segment intersection between objects. Two objects are partially overlapping if they intersect in at least one point.  

An object \emph{A} has a disconnected relationship with an object \emph{B} if \emph{A} does not intersect with \emph{B}, there are no points in \emph{A} that are inside \emph{B}, and there are no points in \emph{B} that are inside \emph{A}. The disconnected relationship is qualified by checking for line segment intersection and convex hull to point containment. If there are no line segment intersections and no convex hull to point containment relationships, then two objects are disconnected.  

\subsubsection{Spatial Constraint Solver: Topology}
The topological constraint solver qualifies topological relationships over convex hull objects. Its implementation extends the Sindalog \ref{Sindalog} spatial constraint solver by integrating topological constraints over convex hulls. It is written using CHR that simplify and propagate topological constraints into less complex geometric constraints of line segment intersection and convex hull to point containment. For example, qualification for the partially overlapping topological relationship involves solving line segment intersection constraints between two convex hulls. The partially overlapping relationship is solved to true when there is at least one line intersection between the convex hulls and it fails when there are none. 

%requires simplifying the overlapping constraint into line segment intersection constraints between the line segments of the convex hulls. The overlapping constraint is solved when at least one line intersection constraint is solved to true or when there are no more line intersection constraints left in the constraint store. In the former case the constraint returns true and in the latter case returns a failure. 

%Once a constraint is in a solvable form, in this case a line intersection or convex hull to point containment constraint, it is solved and returns true or false based on the outcome of the solution. The topological constraint solver is based on successively breaking down a spatial object (convex hull) or spatial primitive (line, point) until solvable geometric constraints can be checked.

The implementation of the partially overlapping relationship begins with a top level constraint that recursively propagates line segment intersection constraints between each line segment in the convex hulls. In the following constraint the first argument represents a line segment (two points) and the second is a convex hull (list of points)
\begin{verbatim}
   intersect_segment_hull((Pt1, Pt2), [Pt3, Pt4|PS]) <=>
           intersection_segment_segment((Pt1, Pt2), (Pt3, Pt4)),
           intersection_segment_hull(Pt1, Pt2, [Pt4|PS]).
\end{verbatim} The \emph{intersection\_segement\_segmenet} constraint represents the intersection between two line segments and is in a solvable form. The \emph{intersect\_segment\_hull} constraint is a recursive call that will propagate the \emph{intersection\_segement\_segmenet} constraint for the rest of the convex hull. The qualification for the other topological relationships is similar to the partially overlapping constraint presented here, but in addition to the line intersection constraint some relationships use the geometric properties of convex hull to point containment.

%into the constraint store and will be solved when all points in its arguments are fully instantiated. 

%breaks down a convex hull into its line segments and propagates new constraints for line segment to convex hull intersection. The line segment to convex hull intersection constraint further propagates new constraints that check for line segment to line segment intersection. These constraints are the lowest level constraints and are solved when fully instantiated. The following code shows a propagation rule for the overlapping topological relationship for line segment to convex hull intersection. Line segments are represented as a tuple of point, and convex hull are represented as a list of points.   

The topological constraint solver is used in the CRR to query topological relationships over a design. Given two \emph{crr\_id}'s any of the four topological queries can be made: 
\begin{verbatim}
    ?- inside(crr_id1, crr_id2).
    ?- outside(crr_id1, crr_id2).
    ?- partially_overlapping(crr_id1, crr_id2).
    ?- disconnected(crr_id1, crr_id2).
\end{verbatim}Because the topological constraint solver
does not know anything about designs there is an intermediate layer between a topological spatial query (above) and the topological constraint solver that is responsible for retrieving quantitative geometries and transforming them into convex hull abstractions. The following rule handles queries for the inside topological relationship.
\begin{verbatim}
    inside(Id1, Id2) :-
            convexhull_abstraction(Id1, Convex1),
            convexhull_abstraction(Id2, Convex2),
            insdie_convexhull(Convex1, Convex2).
\end{verbatim}

%The CRR design representation structure can be queried for topological relationships using the topological constraint solver. Prolog rules query the abstract representation layer to retrieve the spatial abstractions need for topological qualification. In this case objects will be spatially abstracted into convex hulls. The following rule shows the rule for the inside topological relationship. Note that the rule takes two \emph{crr\_id} as arguements, queries the abstract representation layer to retrieve the entities convex hull abstract representations, and then makes a finally call to the \emph{inside\_convexhull} constraint.


\subsection{Orientation} \label{orientation}
The CRR can qualify two types of orientational relationships, intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic orientational reasoning is based on OPRA$_{m}$. OPRA$_{m}$ partitions space into half-planes, which are defined by lines emanating from a reference point, and defines the qualitative orientational relationships by the half plane in which a second point is located in relation to the reference point. The granularity of an OPRA$_{m}$ relationship, specified by $m$, defines the number of lines emanating from the reference point. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{facing-opra-base-rel}
\caption{OPRA$_{2}$ Space Partitioning}
\label{facing-opra-base-rel}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{facing-opra-base-rel} shows the OPRA$_{2}$ (two lines) partitioning of space, with labels for the base OPRA$_{2}$ relationships. Point \emph{A} is located in half-plane 7 of point \emph{B}'s partitioned space, and \emph{B} is located in half-plane 1 of \emph{A}'s partitioned space. Note that the arrow depicts the point's direction and the half-planes are labeled starting at the point's direction, incrementing counter-clockwise. 

OPRA$_{m}$ relationships are qualified in the CRR by solving a system of linear inequalities, which are based on the lines that emanate from the reference point. Given a point \emph{A} and \emph{B}, the $\theta_{AB}$ symbol refers to $ \tan^{-1} \frac{B_{y} - A_{y}}{B_{x} - A_{X}} $, the $\phi_{A}$ symbol refers to the direction of point \emph{A}, and the \emph{m} symbol refers to the granularity of the OPRA$_{m}$ relations. Equation \ref{opra-eq} shows the system of linear inequalities that qualify OPRA$_{m}$ relationships as referenced from point \emph{A} to point \emph{B}. Using this system of linear inequalities, the OPRA$_{m}$ relationship ($i$) can be solved for \emph{B} in terms of \emph{A}'s OPRA$_{m}$ space.

\begin{equation}\label{opra-eq}
\begin{aligned}
\Big(&\Big(\Big(\frac{i}{2} \, \in \, N \wedge i < 2\Big) \wedge \Big(2\pi - \frac{i-2}{4m} < \theta_{AB} - \phi_{A} < \frac{2\pi}{4m}\Big)\Big) \\
\lor \;\; \Big(&\Big(\frac{i+1}{2} \in N \wedge i \geq 1\Big) \wedge \Big(\theta_{AB} - \phi_{A} = 2\pi \frac{i-1}{4m}\Big)\Big)\Big) \\ \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Extrinsic orientational reasoning is based on the SCC. SCC defines the orientation of a point C (referent) with respect to a point B (relatum) from the viewpoint of a point A (origin).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{scc}
\caption{SCC Partitioning}
\label{scc}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{scc} shows an SCC relationship between three points. The partitioning scheme is based on the orientation of the origin and relatum points. In this example, the third point, the referent, is located in half-plane 5 of the SCC partitioned space, so it has an SCC$_{5}$ relationship with point \emph{A} as related by \emph{B}. 

\begin{equation}\label{scc-eq} 
\begin{aligned}
\Big(&\Big(\Big(A_{y} < B_{y}\Big) \wedge \Big(C_{y} > M_{perp} \cdot C_{x} + Y_{perp}\Big)\Big) \; \lor \\
\Big(&\Big(A_{y} > B_{y}\Big) \wedge \Big(C_{y} < M_{perp} \cdot C_{x} + B_{perp}\Big)\Big)\Big) \\
\wedge \;\; \Big(&\Big(\Big(A_{x} < B_{x}\Big) \wedge \Big(C_{y} < M_{AB} \cdot C_{x} + B_{AB}\Big)\Big) \; \lor \\
\Big(&\Big(A_{x} > B_{x}\Big) \wedge \Big(C_{y} > M_{AB} \cdot C_{x} + B_{AB}\Big)\Big)\Big) \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

SCC relationships are qualified by solving a system of linear inequalities, which are based on the lines that partition space into the SCC half-planes. Labeling starts at the line that runs between the origin and relatum, starting at zero and incrementing clockwise. Given three points A, B, and C, $M_{AB}$ refers to the slope of line from A to B, $Y_{AB}$ refers to the y-intercept of the line from A to B, $M_{perp}$ refers to the slope of the line that is perpendicular to the line from A to B, and $Y_{perp}$ refers to the y-intercept of the line that is perpendicular to the line from A to B. Given a point \emph{C}, it has an SCC$_{1}$ relationship with points \emph{A} and \emph{B} if the equations in \ref{scc-eq} can be solved. If the equations are not solvable then \emph{C} does not have an SCC$_{1}$ relationship with \emph{A} related to \emph{B}. There are similar systems of inequalities for each of the seven SCC relationships.  


\subsubsection{Spatial Constraint Solver: Orientation}
The orientational constraint solver qualifies OPRA$_{m}$ and SCC relationships over points and directed points. It is written in CLP($\mathbb{R}$) and uses constraints over linear inequalities (Equations \ref{opra-eq}, \ref{scc-eq}) to solve orientational qualification problems. Within the orientational solver there are two modules, one for intrinsic relationships based on OPRA$_{m}$ and one for extrinsic relationships based on SCC.

The OPRA$_{m}$ constraint solver solves extrinsic orientation qualification problems by constraining the linear inequalities in Equation \ref{opra-eq}. Given an origin point \emph{A}, a reference point \emph{B}, and a granularity $m$, the constraint solver will return the OPRA$_{m}$ relationship ($i$) between \emph{A} and \emph{B}. The linear inequalities are constrained as CLP($\mathbb{R}$) constraints and return once all variables in the linear inequalities are instantiated. 

The SCC constraint solver solves intrinsic orientation qualification problems by constraining the linear inequalities in Equation \ref{scc-eq}. Given an origin, a relatum and a referent, the SCC constraint solver will return true or fail based on the resolvability of the linear inequalities. The linear inequalities are constrained as CLP($\mathbb{R}$) constraints and will return true if the linear equalities are solvable and fail if they are not.

The orientational constraint solver is used in the CRR to query orientational relationships over a design. Given two or three \emph{crr\_id}'s the following orientational queries can be made: 
\begin{verbatim}
    ?- scc(crr_id1, crr_id2, crr_id3, base_relation).
    ?- opra(crr_id1, crr_id2, m, i).
\end{verbatim} Because the orientational constraint solver does not know anything about designs there is an intermediate layer between an orientational spatial query (above) and the orientational constraint solver that is responsible for retrieving quantitative geometries and transforming them into point and directed point abstractions. The following rule handles queries for the scc and opra relationships.
\begin{verbatim}
    scc(Id1, Id2, Id3, BR) :-
            point_abstraction(Id1, Pt1),
            point_abstraction(Id2, Pt2),
            point_abstraction(Id3, Pt3),
            scc(Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, BR).

    opra(Id1, Id2, m, i) :-
            directed_point_abstraction(Id1, DPt1),
            directed_point_abstraction(Id2, DPt2),
            opra(DPt1, DPt2, m, i).
\end{verbatim}


%The CRR design representation structure can be queried for orientational relationships using the orientational constraint solver. Prolog rules query the abstract representation layer and retrieve the spatial abstractions need for orientational qualification: point and directed point. The following rule shows the rule for the SCC$)_{1}$ relationship.

%Given three entities with \emph{crr\_id}’s \emph{door45}, \emph{room53}, and \emph{desk2} the following query will return true if the entities have an SCC$_{1}$ relationship and will fail if they do not. In this specific case they do have an SCC$_{1}$ relationship so the query returns true.
%\begin{verbatim}
%    ?- SCC1(door45, room53, desk2).
%    true.
%\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Distance}
The CRR can calculate the minimum euclidean distance between points, lines, and polygons. Given two objects the minimum distance is calculated by 1) finding the closest point in each object to the other object and 2) calculating the minimum euclidean distance between the two points. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=80mm]{min-dist}
\caption{Minimum Distance}
\label{min-dist}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Spatial Constraint Solver: Distance}
The distance constraint solver calculates minimum distance queries and uses the distance constraint services of the Sindalog \cite{sindalog} spatial constraint solver for all distance calculations. The distance constraint solver is different from the other two because it returns a specific value, instead of returning \emph{true} or \emph{fail} based on a query. For example, the following query will return the minimum distance between the two objects in D.
\begin{verbatim}
   min_distance(obj1, obj2, D). 
\end{verbatim}

The distance constraint solver is written using CHR that break down the constraints until they can be solved for. This process involves finding the located on each object that is the closest to the other, so that the minimum distance can be calculated between the two. 


\chapter{Conceptual Requirements Reasoner} \label{conceptual requirements}
This chapter presents the conceptual requirements reasoning framework of the DSpace reasoner. It shows how architectural concepts and qualitative spatial attributes found in architecture (QSA) can be spatially interpreted using formal qualitative spatial calculi and shows how they can be represented and reasoned with to validate conceptual design requirements in the conceptual requirements reasoner (CCR). 

Conceptual design requirements were ascertained from literature on architectural design \cite{tbd}, museum research on visitor behavior \cite{tbd}, and building regulations and codes \cite{tbd}. Their definitions are explicit characterizations of architectural concepts and spatial design qualities that are based on heuristic architectural knowledge and common sense notions of spatial relationships. The objective is not to be an exhaustive discussion of these requirements or a validation for their interpretation in terms of a spatial or design perspective; rather it is to demonstrate how each can be represented and reasoned with in the DSpace CLP framework to validate conceptual design requirements against the quantitative form of a design. 

In the DSpace CLP framework, QSA and architectural concepts utilize the DSpace design representation structure, via the spatial abstraction layer, and the DSpace spatial reasoner to validate conceptual design requirements. QSA and architectural concepts are implemented as Prolog rules. Each rule is implemented as a conjunction of predicates that spatially define the QSA and architectural concepts from a qualitative perspective. Conceptual design requirements can be specified using QSA, architectural concepts, and qualitative spatial relationships. Validating a design requirement happens by making a Prolog query to the CCR that will return \emph{true} if the design is consistent per the requirement or \emph{fail} if the design is inconsistent per the requirement. 

The chapter is structured as follows: Section 1 presents a set of qualitative spatial attributes found in architecture, shows how each can be interpreted using formal qualitative spatial calculi, and represented formally within DSpace CRR. Section 2 presents a set of architectural concepts that are built using the spatial qualities presented in the Section 1 and shows how they can be used to reason about design requirements within the DSpace CRR. Section 3 shows how conceptual design requirements can be validated in using the CRR.


\section{Qualitative Spatial Attributes found in Architecture}
This section presents a set of qualitative spatial attributes found in architecture (QSA) and shows how each QSA is spatially interpreted and represented in DSpace. QSAs are architectural qualities that emerge from the spatial structures that form from the physical elements of the building (doors, walls, columns, windows, etc.), artefactual extensions (functional space, operational space, range space, etc.) and interior design elements (furniture, lights, decorations, etc.). QSAs can be perceptual qualities that are described from a specific vantage point, or intrinsic qualities that are inherent in the build's spatial structure. 

This section presents five QSAs: positioning, positioning for sequences, facing, visibility, and proximity. The goal of this section is to develop a tool-kit of QSAs that qualitatively describe architectural designs in the spatial environments in which they emerge. Some boundary cases are identified and handled, but it is not the purpose here to explore all possible case scenarios.

\subsection{Positioning}
The positioning attribute defines an orientational relationship between a pair of objects as each object relates to the other within an extrinsic context, i.e., a defined space such as a room, apartment, building, or user defined space. There are four positioning relationships using this scheme: opposing-side of space, same-side of space, left-side of space, and right-side of space. The opposing-side and same-side relationships can be combined, via conjunction, with the left-side or right-side relationships to form the following compound relationships: opposing-left-side, opposing-right-side, same-left-side, same-right-side.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=80mm]{position}
\caption{Positioning}
\label{position}
\end{figure}

The positioning attribute is interpreted spatially, in DSpace, using the Single Cross Calculus (SCC) \cite{Freksa92usingorientation}. SCC defines the orientation of a point C (referent) with respect to a point B (relatum) from the viewpoint of a point A (origin). The positioning attribute uses the SCC partitioning scheme to orientationally relate two points (origin, referent) in the context of an external frame of reference (relatum). In DSpace, the reference point is defined as the centroid of the context space. By partitioning space using the centroid, an approximation is made that divides the space into the positioning relationships. An assumption made in DSpace is that the space will generally be rectangular in shape.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{scc}
\caption{SCC Partitioning}
\label{scc}
\end{figure}

Under this scheme, two points are defined as being on opposing sides of a space if they have an SCC relationship of 0, 1 or 7, as related by the centroid of the space. Conversely, a pair of points are defined as being on the same side of a space if they have an SCC relationship of 3, 4 or 5, as related by the centroid of the  space. A point is defined as being on the left side of a space from another point if it has an SCC relationship of 5, 6, or 7, and is on the right side if it has an SCC relationship of 1, 2, or 3. Using the union set operation these relationships can be combined to form the opposing-left/right, and same-left/right relationships.

Th positioning relationships are represented in the DSpace CLP framework as Prolog rules. There is a single rule for each relationships: opposing side, same-side, left-side, and right-side. The head of each rule takes three arguments, the first two for the architectural objects being related and one for the context space. The body of the rule ....  The following is Prolog code for the positioning rules.
\begin{verbatim}
   opposing_side(Obj1, Obj2, Context) :- 
           centroid(Context, Centroid),
           (scc(Obj1, Centroid, Obj2, 0);
            scc(Obj1, Centroid, Obj2, 1);
            scc(Obj1, Centroid, Obj2, 7)).
                                          
   same_side(Obj1, Obj2, Context) :- 
           centroid(Context, Centroid),
           (scc(Obj1, Centroid, Obj2, 2) ;
            scc(Obj1, Centroid, Obj2, 3) ;
            scc(Obj1, Centroid, Obj2, 4) ;
            scc(Obj1, Centroid, Obj2, 5) ;
            scc(Obj1, Centroid, Obj2) 6)).   

\end{verbatim}

The positioning attribute can be used to check if architectural structures, artefactual extensions, or interior design elements are on the opposing or same side of a space to the other. For example, a requirement might state that a bedroom should be positioned to the back of a house from the main entrance. The reason for this requirement is that rooms that are in the back of a house are more private than rooms in the front of the house. In this requirement, the origin is the entrance, the referent is the bedroom, and the relatum is the centroid of the house (context space). 
\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=95mm]{bedroom-back-house}
 \caption{Bedroom Privacy}
\label{privacy}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Positioning for Sequences}
The positioning for a sequences attribute defines a perceptual orientational relationship of a sequence of objects as each relates to a vantage point in an extrinsic context, i.e., a defined space such as a room, apartment, building, or user defined space. A sequence is a set of architectural entities (columns), or interior design objects (display cases) that are grouped together and comprised of the same entity or object type. In general sequences are grouped together based on the proximity of the objects (near to each other) but any relationship can define a sequence. There are three positioning relationships for a sequence of objects: horizontal perceived, vertical perceived, and neither.  

The positioning for a sequence of objects attribute can be spatially interpreted using SCC, similar to the positioning attribute above. The positioning for a sequence of objects attribute uses the SCC partitioning scheme to orientationally relate a sequence of points (origin, referents) in the context of an external frame of reference (relatum). In DSpace, the reference point is defined as the centroid of the context space. By partitioning space using the centroid, an approximation is made that divides the space into the positioning relationships. As with the positioning attribute, an assumption made in DSpace is that the space will generally be rectangular in shape.

Using the SCC partitioning of space, a sequence of objects is perceived horizontally from the vantage point if the sequence of points have the following combination of SCC relationships (origin = vantage point, relatum = context centroid, referent = sequence point): at least one point in the sequence has an SCC$_{5}$ or SCC$_{6}$ or SCC$_{7}$ relationship and at least one point has an SCC$_{1}$ or SCC$_{2}$ or SCC$_{3}$ relationships. A sequence of points is perceived vertically if they have the following combination of SCC relationships: at least one point in the sequence has an SCC$_{5}$ or SCC$_{3}$ relationship and at least one point in the sequence has an SCC$_{0}$ or SCC$_{1}$ or SCC$_{7}$ relationship. Sequences can be both vertical and horizontal at the same time or they can be neither. The neither relationship is defined by a sequence of object that do not match any of the sets above.

TODO: figures

Th positioning for a sequence of objects relationships are represented in DSpace as Prolog rules. There is a single rule for each relationship: horizontally perceived, vertically perceived, diagonally perceived, and . The head of each rule takes three arguments, the first for the the vantage point, the second is a list of objects that represent the sequence and the third is the context space. The body of the rule .... Given a vantage point, a sequence of objects and a context space, the rule returns true if the objects are on the horizontally perceived, vertically perceived, diagonally perceived, or confined as defined by its' rule, and fails if they are not. The following is Prolog code for the positioning rules.
\begin{verbatim}
   horizontally_perceived(vantage_point, seq_list, context) :-
           centroid(context, Centroid),
           horizontally_
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Facing}
The facing attribute defines an intrinsic orientational relationship between two objects as each object relates to the other. The definition used here is based on a common sense interpretation of facing, in which an object \emph{A} is facing towards an object \emph{B}, if \emph{A} is directionally oriented at \emph{B}. Under this definition, a pair of objects can be facing towards or away from each other. Given a pair of objects, \emph{A} and \emph{B}, there are four possible facing configurations between the pair:

The facing attribute is spatially modelled in DSpace using the Oriented Point Relation Algebra \cite{Moratz} (OPRA). The advantage of using OPRA is that it models the intrinsic orientational relationships between a pair of directed points. TODO: mention something about the section that talks about OPRA. Using OPRA$_{8}$, the facing attribute can be defined in terms of the half plane sectors. Point \emph{A} is facing towards point \emph{B}, if \emph{B} is located in sectors 0, 1, or 32 of \emph{A}'s partitioned space. Similarly, if \emph{A} is located in sectors 0, 1, or 32 of \emph{B}'s partitioned space then \emph{B} is facing towards \emph{A}. In this case, both points are facing towards each other. Conversely, point \emph{A} is facing away from point \emph{B} if \emph{B} is located in sectors 2 - 31 of \emph{A's} partitioned space. A granularity of 8 is used (i.e., OPRA$_{8}$) to define a narrow interpretation of the facing attribute. Within a room, doorways, windows, and walls are generally face towards each other. By narrowing the space that is considered facing towards, it allows DSpace to detect elements that are more directly facing towards each other.

Figure \ref{fig:facing-opra-towards} shows an example of two points facing towards each other; note that each point is located in sector 32 of the other's partitioned space.  Figure \ref{fig:facing-opra-away} shows an example of two points that are facing away from each other and are not located in sectors 0, 1, 32 of the other's partitioned space.

\end{figure}

The facing attribute is represented in DSpace as Prolog rules. There is one rule for facing-towards and one for facing-away. The head of each rule takes two arguments for the objects being related. The body of the rule is a single disjunctive clause that checks for the OPRA$_{8}$ relationship between the objects. Given two objects, the rule returns true if the objects are facing towards or away from each other as defined by the rule, and fails if they are not. The following is Prolog code for the facing rules.

\begin{verbatim}
   facing_towards(Obj1, Obj2) :- 
           (opra(Obj1, Obj2, 0) ;
            opra(Obj1, Obj2, 1) ;
            opra(Obj1, Obj2, 32)).
                                 
   facing_away(Obj1, Obj2) :- 
           not facing_towards(Obj1, Obj2).                     
\end{verbatim}

In DSpace, the facing attribute can be used to check if two architectural structures, artefactual extensions, or interior design elements are facing towards or away from each other. For example, doorways and windows that face towards each other promote airflow through the space they inhibit. A design that requires good air circulation could use this knowledge to ensure proper airflow. Figure \ref{door-window-facing} shows two example floor plans of a room with a window and doorway. Figure \ref{fig:door-window-towards} shows a configuration were the doorway and window are facing towards each other, while figure \ref{fig:door-window-away} shows a configuration where the doorway and window are facing away from each other. 

\begin{figure}[H]

 \subfloat[facing away]{\label{fig:door-window-away}\includegraphics[width=53mm]{door-facing-window-incon}}
 \caption{Door, Window Facing}
\label{door-window-facing}
\end{figure}

Within the context of architecture, care needs to be taken to account for architectural structures that are long in one axis, such as walls, because the spatial abstraction for OPRA is a directed point. This means that an object is defined as facing towards a wall if it is facing towards the wall's directed point abstraction (usually the centroid of the wall). Under this definition, there are configurations where an object should be considered to be facing a wall but it is not. DSpace handles this special case by modifying the OPRA$_{8}$ relationships that correspond to facing towards and away from a wall. 

fig: wall example

\subsection{Proximity}
The proximity attribute defines a qualitative distance relationship between two objects. In DSpace, there are three proximity relationships: near, near+, and far. The spatial interpretation of proximity is defined in the context of architecture, which is restricted here to be \emph{within a building}. Based on this interpretation, proximity is formally defined using heuristics based on what is consider near, near+, and far within a building.   


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=45mm]{proximity}
\caption{Proximity}
\label{proximity}
\end{figure}

Using these heuristics, two objects are near if the minimum distance between them is less then or equal to 3 meters, near+ if the minimum distance between then is between 3 - 6 meters, and far if the minimum distance between them is greater then 3 meters. While the definition of proximity pivots around 3 and 6 meters, it can easily be changed by using an extra parameter in a proximity predicate. 

Proximity is represented in DSpace as three Prolog rules. There is one rule for near, one for near+, and one for far. The head of each rule takes two arguments for the architectural objects being related. The body of the rule .... Given two objects, the rule returns true if the objects are near, near+, or far from each other as defined by the rule, and fails if they are not. The following is Prolog code for the proximity rules.

\begin{verbatim}
   near(Obj1, Obj2) :- 
           minimum_distance_compare(Obj1, Obj2, <=, 3).
   
   near_plus(Obj1, Obj2) :-
           minimum_distance_compare(Obj1, Obj2, <=, 6),
           minimum_distance_compare(Obj1, Obj2, >, 3).   
   
   far(Obj1, Obj2) :- 
           minimum_distance_compare(Obj1, Obj2, >, 6)

\end{verbatim}

The proximity attribute can be used to check whether two architectural structures, artefactual extension, or interior design elements are near or far. For example, a computer desk should be located near a power outlet to make it easy to power up the desk's computer and desk's lamp. Another example is the bathroom should be far away from the kitchen, in order to keep a separation between the two.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=50mm]{desk-proximity}
 \caption{Desk Outlet Proximity}
\label{desk-proximity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Visibility}
The visibility attribute defines a boolean relationship between a viewpoint and an object with respect to the object being visible from the viewpoint. This interpretation of visibility is based on the topological characteristics of an object blocking (obstructing) a view. It does not take into account the material characteristics of the obstructing object, such as glass, which would allow visibility through the obstructing object. Additionally it does not take into account the effects of distance on visibility, i.e., an object that is very far away is not visible. However, within the context of architecture and buildings, the magnitude of distances is limited to a point that it is not a factor to visibility. Under this definition, an objects is visible if the view-space (i.e., the space between the viewpoint and the object) is not obstructed.

The spatial interpretation of visibility is based on the topological characteristics of the space in-between the viewpoint and object. This space is referred to as the view-space. An object is visible if the view-space is not obstructed by surrounding structures or objects. An obstructing object is an object that has a partially overlapping or containing topological relationship with the view-space. Artefactual extension is not considered as an obstructing object because it does not have a physical form. This definition does not distinguish between visibility that is partially or totally obstructed.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \subfloat[obstructed view]{\label{fig:obstructed-view}\includegraphics[width=55mm]{visibility}}
  \hspace{10 mm}
 \subfloat[non-obstructed view]{\label{fig:no-obstruction}\includegraphics[width=55mm]{visibility-no-obstruction}}
 \caption{Visibility}
\label{Visibility}
\end{figure}

Visibility is represented in DSpace as a single Prolog rule. The head of the rule takes two arguments, the viewpoint and the object that is being check for visibility. The body of the clause calculates the view-space and checks the surrounding objects for a topological obstruction. Given a viewpoint and an object, the rule returns true if the object is visible, and fails if it is not. The following is the Prolog code for the visibility rule.

\begin{verbatim}
   is_visible(ViewPoint, Obj) :- 
           view_space(ViewPoint, Obj, ViewSpace),
           topology(ViewSpace, SurroundingStructs).
\end{verbatim}

The visibility attribute can be used to check if an architectural structure or interior design element is visible from a given viewpoint. For example, an architect might want to ensure that a staircase is visible from the main entrance of a building, because she doesn't want the staircase to go unnoticed. Figure \ref{visibility-door-stair} shows an example floor plan where the stairway is not visible from the doorway. In this example both the wall in red and column are obstructing the view from the doorway.

\end{figure}



\section{Architectural Concepts}
Architectural concepts, such as privacy, continuity, and enclosure, are experiential aspects of architecture that are used by architects to describe the functionality of a design \cite{Koile}. These terms are defined in DSpace in a hierarchical manner in which architectural concepts are built using QSAs and geometric primitives (orientation, topology, distance). 

This section presents four architectural concepts and demonstrates how each is defined in DSpace. As in the previous section, the purpose is not to investigate the correctness of the concepts or an attempt to compile a complete list, rather it is to look at how these concepts can be defined logically using architectural qualities and spatial / geometric primitives.

\subsection{Privacy}
In architecture, the concept of privacy implies a notion of separation and obscurity (not being visible). In the case of a room, privacy can be defined as being separated from the main entrance of the building and having doorways that enhances the room's privacy. A doorway can be be defined as private with respect to its functionality of connecting two adjacent areas (rooms, hallways, etc.). Under this consideration, a doorway can enhance or hinder the privacy of a room. A doorway enhances privacy of a room if the doorway faces away from other local doorways (doorways in adjacent rooms) and if it is not visible from the main living space. 

Within DSpace, the concept of privacy has been formally defined for rooms and doorways. A door is private if it has the following attributes: (1) it is not visible from the main living space, (2) it does not mutually face towards another doorway and (3) it does not face towards the centroid of an adjacent room. A room is private if it has the following attributes: (1) it is positioned on the opposing side of the building with regard to the main entrance and (2) all doorways into the room are private, per the doorway privacy definition.
 
Privacy is represented in DSpace as Prolog rules. The rules take a single argument, in the head, which indicates if the rule is for a room or doorway. The body of the rule defines the properties of the privacy using QSAs, as defined above. Note that there are two predicates, one for the definition of privacy for a room and one for privacy of a doorway.  

\begin{verbatim}
   private(room) :-  
           opposing_side(room, main_entrance, building), 
           private(doorway).
                     
   private(door) :- 
           facing_away(door, door),
           facing_away(door, adjacent_space),
           not_visible(door, main_living_space). 
\end{verbatim}

Figure \ref{room-privacy} shows two floor plans for a small single bedroom house; figure \ref{fig:private-room-con} shows a floor plan with a bedroom that is  private, while figure \ref{fig:private-room-incon} shows a similar floor plan with a bedroom that is not private. The numbers in the figures represent the following privacy requirements: (1) the bedroom is positioned on the opposing side of the building with regards to the main entrance, (2) the doorway is not visible from the main living space, and (3) the doorway does not mutually face towards another doorway. Numbers that are colored red indicate that the requirement has been broken, while numbers in green indicate that the requirement has been met.

\begin{figure}[H]

 \subfloat[Not Private]{\label{fig:private-room-incon}\includegraphics[width=69mm]{privacy-room-incon}}
 \caption{Bedroom Privacy}
\label{room-privacy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Continuity}
In architecture, the concept of continuity describes a network of points that are mutually visible \cite{Key}. In DSpace, continuity is interpreted in the context of building navigation and wayfinding and is therefore dependent on continuity between doorways withing the design. Other interpretations of continuity can use any element of the design (beyond doorways), however for the purposes here, continuity only deals with doorways. Under this interpretation, a building, room or apartment is continuous if there is continuity between the doorways contained in a given space: room, building, or apartment. 

Continuity is defined as a network of doorways that are mutually visible. The partitioning of doorways that should be mutually visible is based on a localized containment hierarchy between rooms and doorways, in which doorways that are contained in the same room should maintain continuity. It does not make sense for doorways that are located on opposite sides of a building to be visible to each other, but doorways that are in the same room should be. 

With respect to this definition, continuity is represented as a recursive rule in Prolog, which takes a list of doorways and checks that each doorway is mutually visible to the others within the list. (need to mention doorways within a room). TBD: arguments: list of doors or room id that indicates containment level???

\begin{verbatim}
   continuous([Obj1,Obj2|[]]) :- 
           is_visible(Obj1, Obj2).

   continuous([Obj1,Obj2|OS]) :- 
           is_visible(Obj1, Obj2),
	       is_visible(Obj2, Obj1),
           continuity([Obj1|OS]),
           continuity([Obj2|OS]).
\end{verbatim}

Figure \ref{continuity} shows a floor plan for a single room with three doors. Figure \ref{fig:continuity-con} shows a configuration in which each door is mutually visible to the other doors. This design is continuous. Conversely, figure \ref{fig:continuity-incon} shows a configuration in which door 1 is not mutually visible to door 2 and door 1 is not mutually visible door 3. The visibility between door 1 and door 2 is obstructed by a column and the visibility between door 1 and door 3 is obstructed by a wall. Structural elements that are colored red indicated a visibility obstruction. This design is not continuous.

  \hspace{30 mm}
 \subfloat[Inconsistent]{\label{fig:continuity-incon}\includegraphics[width=45mm]{continuity-incon}}
 \caption{Continuity}
\label{continuity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Enclosure} 
In architecture, the concept of enclosure defines a space, as experienced from a given vantage point, as being confined or open. A tbdspace space is defined as being confined by walls or columns, while an open space is defined as being spacious. In DSpace, enclosure is defined by localized spatial structures in terms of their proximity to a given point. Under this interpretation, a room, apartment, or building can be experienced as both confined and open based on the location of the vantage point within the space. Such a definition takes into account that enclosure is locally experienced. For example, an alcove in an otherwise open room, feels confined when experienced from inside the alcove.

In Dspace, a point is defined as open if less then three walls or columns are near-to the point. Conversely, a point is defined as confined if three or more walls or columns are near-to the point. While this interpretation of enclosure is naive, it maintains the notion that proximity defines the spatial structures of openness and confinement in a localized environment.   

\begin{verbatim}
confined(point) :-  

spacious(point) :-

\end{verbatim} 

Figure \ref{enclosure} shows a floor plan for a single room with various enclosure properties. The room contains an alcove and a sequence of columns that will provide an environment of confinement. Points in-between the columns and inside the alcove are confined because of the proximity of the walls and/or columns. The points outside of these areas are open because there are few structures nearby.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=60mm]{spacious-confined}
\caption{Enclosure, Confined and Open}
\label{enclosure}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Artefactual Requirements}
Artefactual requirements are a special case in this section because they are not strictly architectural concepts. However, they provide a unique set of architectural requirements that incorporate a breadth of design aspects. This section will take a look at two examples of artefactual interference. 

Artefactual interference deals with the unintentional interactions of the operational and functional spaces of a building's structural form. For example, the operational space of a bathroom doorway that overlaps with the functional space of the bathroom sink will cause circulation problems into and out of the bathroom. In DSpace, this type of interaction can be detected using topological reasoning over the artefactual extensions of the entities. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=50mm]{door-sink}
\caption{Sink Doorway Interference}
\label{door-sink-example}
\end{figure}

This type of artefactual interaction can be checked for in DSpace using a single rule that takes two arguments in the head of the rule. The body of the rule retrieves the artefactual geometry of each element and checks their topological relationship. It fails if the artefacts have an overlapping relationship.

\begin{verbatim}
   bathroom_sink_door(sink, door) :- 
           artefact_geometry(sink, Artefact_sink),
           artefact_geometry(door, Artefact_door),
           not_overlapping(Artefact_sink, Artefact_door).
\end{verbatim}

Artefactual interactions can be between a physical structure (door, wall, column, ect.) and artefactual extension. For example, the landing space (operational space in DSpace parlance) of a stair should be clear. Representing this requirement is similar to the bathroom sink example except that it checks for interactions between the stair's artefactual space with the building physical space.

In DSpace this can be represented as a single rule. The body of the rule checks for an overlapping relationship between the landing space of the stair and both the artefactual extension and physical structure of surrounding elements.

TBD: figure of stair landing

\begin{verbatim}
    clear_stair_landing(stair, Obj) :- 
            artefact_geometry(stair, Artefact_stair),
            artefact_geometry(Obj, Artefact_obj),
            physical_geometry(Obj, Physical),
            not_overlapping(Artefact_stair, Artefact_obj),
            not_overlapping(Artefact_stair, Physical)
\end{verbatim}  

\section{Conceptual Requirement Validation}
The conceptual requirement reasoner (CCR) validates design requirements by querying an architectural design using predicate calls to architectural concepts and QSA. Requirement queries will return \emph{true} if the architectural design is consistent, or \emph{fail} if the design is inconsistent per the design requirement. A design is considered consistent if the design's spatial characteristics, as represented in its physical and functional geometries, matches with the definition of the designs requirement specification. For example, a design is consistent per a design requirement of a window and doorway facing towards each other, if the spatial characteristic of the design, with regards to the window and doorway, match the spatial specification of facing towards each other.    

Given the example scenario above, a doorway with crr\_id \emph{door543}, and a window with crr\_id \emph{window15}, the following query is made to the CRR to validate the requirement.
\begin{verbatim}
   ?- facing(door543, window15).
\end{verbatim}
Queries to architectural concepts and QSA can be combined to build requirements. For example, a design requirement for a doorway and window being near each other can be combined with the previous requirement to build a new requirement. This requirement can be queried directly or implemented as a new Prolog rule. 
\begin{verbatim}
   ?- facing(door543, window15),
      near(door15, window15).
      
    facing_and_near(Id1, Id1) :-
            near(Id1, Id2),
            facing(Id1, Id2).
\end{verbatim}
Note that the direct query is specific to \emph{door543} and \emph{window15}, while the rule allows the user to input any \emph{crr\_id}'s into the query.
\begin{verbatim}
    ?- facing_and_near(desk52, door6).
\end{verbatim}

Consider the design requirement for a bedroom being private. This requirement can be validated for a design by querying the privacy predicate, as demonstrated above. However, this definition of privacy might not be enough for a particular user. In DSpace, the user can easily extend the definition of privacy by building new Prolog rules that join additional architectural concepts, QSA, and spatial qualities to the existing definition. If the user wants the definition of privacy to include an additional requirement that the bedroom is far away from the living room, the user can construct a new rule by joining the privacy predicate with the proximity predicate. The following is the new predicate for privacy:
\begin{verbatim}
    privacy_new(IdRoom, IdLivingRoom) :-
            privacy(IdRoom),
            far(IdRoom, IdLivingRoom).
\end{verbatim}



\chapter{Museum Case Study}
This chapter is a case study that demonstrates the application of the CRR in the context of design for an art museum. The purpose is twofold: first, to examine design requirements of an art museum with regards to their affects on visitors experiences in a museum; and second, to demonstrate the application of the CRR for validating these design requirements within a real world museum scenario. 

%how the museum design requirements can be represented and reasoned about in a computational framework, in order to detect design inconsistencies as per the design requirements.

This chapter is divided into two sections. The first section sets up the context of the case study by examining museum design characteristics that influence visitors' behavior and experiences within an art museum. This section has two parts: the first part looks at museum characteristics that affect how visitors behave with museums galleries. The second part looks at the characteristics of a museum's Lobby that influence visitors orientation. The second section of the Chapter demonstrates the application of the CRR to the previously identified museum requirements.  

%examines design requirements in art museums in three parts: the first part looks at requirements that influence museum visitors' behavior. The second part looks at requirements for promoting exploration in the museum. The third part looks at the requirements of accessibility and security within the museum. The second section, looks at how these requirements can be interpreted spatially and represented in the CRR. The third section tests the DSpace reasoner using sample museum floor plans that are both consistent and inconsistent per the design requirements for several art museums. The objective of this demonstration is to show that the DSpace reasoner can validate a design against its design requirements.


\section{Museums}
Museums are a place of public education, in which art, historical artefacts, and scientific exhibits are put on display for the public to view \cite{Falk}. While museums in general have many common threads in terms of their design requirements, this case study takes the approach of narrowing the study to that of an art museum. This focuses the discussion to specific real world examples and maintains the perspective that this is not an exhaustive study of museum design requirements, rather it's an investigation into the nature and interpretation, with respect to spatial properties / characteristics, of a set of design requirements. Additionally, the point is not to prove the validity of these requirements in an empirical sense; rather it is to show the process of representing and reasoning about design requirements in a formal computational framework.

The art museum is a unique and fruitful choice for this case study because it provides a rich set of design properties that have been formally studied and reported \cite{Melton} \cite{Bitgood02} \cite{Falk}. Within museum studies, visitor behaviour has been one of the primary focuses, starting with experiments dating back to the 1930's. 

\subsection{Museum Design Requirements}
Pretend for a moment that you are an architect working on the initial design for a new modern art museum. During your first visit with the museum's curator you discuss several design requirements that are important for the new museum. Your discussion reveals that the curator wants the new art museum to adhere to the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Maximize visitor utilization of exhibitions
\item Visitor Orientation in Lobby
\end{enumerate}

TBD: explain how these high level requirements can be interpreted into concrete properties of the museums design. from here the requirements can be spatially interpreted and represented in the DSpace reasoner.

\subsection{Maximizing Visitor Utilization of Exhibitions}
This portion of the case study will look into four factors that influence visitors' movement patters: positioning of doorways, spatial arrangement of display cases, positioning of furniture and statues, congestion, and exploration. These properties inform museum architects, during the design process, about the spatial characteristics that can maximize the utilization of the museum by increasing the frequency and duration with which visitors view exhibition objects. 


\subsubsection{Positioning of doorways}
In an important study, Melton \cite{Melton} discovered that the most influential factor to determine  the amount of attention an exhibition piece receives is the pieces's position relative to doorways in a gallery room. Prior to this, museum researchers believed that the pieces's intrinsic properties of 'interestingness', color, and size were the real factors that determined the amount of attention a piece received. Melton explained why this happens; he demonstrated that the amount of attention a piece receives is directly related to the visitor circulation patterns within the museum and these circulation patterns emerge from the spatial characteristics of the museum's architecture.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \subfloat[circulation pattern]{\label{fig:door-opposite}\includegraphics[width=35mm, angle=90]{melton-circulation}}
 \hspace{10 mm}

 \label{melton}
 \caption{Results from Melton's experiments on the effects of door positioning in an Art Museum}
\label{Melton-studies}
\end{figure}

The crux of Melton's experiments suggested that visitors exit through the first door they encounter, which he referred to as the exit gradient. Figure \ref{Melton-studies} shows the results of an extensive study of visitors circulation patterns and stopping frequencies in an art museum. The studies reported that almost 80 percent of visitors exited through the first exit they encountered before viewing the entire exhibition. Additionally, the studied showed that the most frequently visited objects where those located along the shortest path from the entrance to the exit. 

Furthermore, Bitgood suggests that visitors tend to follow along the wall that is closest to the door they entered \cite{Bitgood95}. Given that visitors also tend to exit through the first doorway they encounter, doorways should not be positioned in a wall that is close to an entrance. 

The results of Melton's and Bitgood's studies inform architects of spatial characteristics that influence movement patterns in exhibitions. Specifically, doorways that are positioned on the same side of the room and doorways that are position in a wall adjacent to an entrance cause visitors to pay attention to fewer exhibits than doorways that are positioned on opposing sides of the room and in walls that are not adjacent to entrances.

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 1:] \emph{Gallery doorways should be positioned on opposing sides of a gallery room and should not be contained in walls that are close to other doorways.} 
\end{description}


Figure \ref{door-position} shows a possible exhibition design where the red door is positioned on the same side of the room as the entrance, while the black door is positioned on the opposing side.

\subfloat[consistent design]{\label{fig:door-opposite}\includegraphics[width=85mm]{door-possitioning}}
\caption{Schematization of the opposing door requirement.}
\label{door-position}
\end{figure} 


\subsubsection{Spatial arrangement of display cases}
The spatial arrangement of display cases in galleries has been shown to influence visitors' movement patterns. \cite{Bitgood92} showed that display case arrangements that form a perimeter or a peninsula generate the most amount of attention, while display case arrangements that form an island in the middle of the room received the lowest amount of attention.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \subfloat[island]{\label{fig:door-opposite}\includegraphics[width=35mm]{island}}

\label{display-arrangement}
\end{figure}
 
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 2:] \emph{Display case arrangements should not form an island near the center of the room.}
\end{description} 

Circulation patterns can be disrupted when a peninsula arrangement cuts horizontally across the view of a visitor as they are entering the room. This type of display pattern will cut off part of the room from the visitor and will make it less likely to be visited.

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 3:] \emph{Display cases arrangements should not cut horizontally across the view of a visitor located at an entrance.}
\end{description}

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Congestion}
Congestion in museums can be caused by interference of displayed objects and their viewing spaces with movement pathways of visitors. In order to reduce congestion in museums, designers should be aware of the placement of display cases, statues, furniture (seating benches), and information kiosks within the gallery. The following are requirements that should be followed to reduce congestion in museums:

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 4:] \emph{There should be no artefactual interference between architectural entities, museum display cases, museum seating, and information kiosks.}
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Positioning of benches, statues, and information kiosks}
The positioning and orientation of benches and statues can increase the amount of attention an exhibition receives and change circulation patterns within a gallery \cite{Stavroulaki} \cite{Museum}. Studies have shown that seating directly facing an object will increase the attention the object receives, even if no one uses the seating. 

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 5:] \emph{Seating should directly face a gallery wall or display case.}
\end{description}

The orientation of a statue to doorways can increase the attention the statue receives as well as the object close to it. Statues that face away from doorways encourage visitors to move around the statues in order to get a better view.  
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 6:] \emph{Statues should face away from doorways.}
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Exploration}
The way visitors explore an exhibition is influenced by the spatial characteristics of the layout, as well as the characteristics of each gallery room. Layouts that are sequential, i.e. one way in / one way out, promote a controlled and orderly flow of movement. Museums of history and science are well served by this type of design because they have a narrative to tell that is chronological. On the other hand, layouts that present the visitor with path choices, i.e. multiple doorways, promote free-flowing exploration. In this type of layout it is important that visitors are aware of the path choices that are available. This means that doorways are visible between each other throughout the layout. This concept of visibility between a network of points is referred to as continuity and is an important characteristic of layouts that present visitors with multiple path choices.  

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 7:] The layout of the museum should maintain continuity between doorways within each exhibition and gallery room.
\end{description}

%Within a Gallery, rooms that are open promote more free-flowing exploration than rooms that are narrow. Narrow rooms inhibit exploration because of space limitations and confinement. Rooms that are open provide more space for visitors to explore the room in a free-flowing manner.
%\begin{description}
%\item[Requirement 11:] Gallery rooms should be open, rather than confined, in order to promote free-flowing exploration.
%\end{description}


\subsection{Visitor Orientation in the lobby}
The lobby is the first place visitors encounter when they enter a museum. The design of the lobby is important because it not only provides a first glimpse of the museum's exhibits but it is the place where the museum provides services to its visitors, including: a ticketing desk, bathrooms, an information desk, and entrances to exhibitions \cite{Bitgood02}. The aim of the requirements for the lobby focus on making it easy for visitors to locate services and orient themselves to the new environment. 

Upon entering the lobby most visitors need to find the ticket area and/or an information desk. It is important, therefore, that the ticketing area and information desk are visible from the entrance. Additionally, studies have shown that people first look to their right hand side when entering a building. By placing the ticket and information desks on the right hand side of the lobby, visitors are more likely to notice them immediately when they enter the lobby. Finally, the ticketing area should be close to visitors when they enter because it is likely one of the first places they will need to visit.
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 8:] \emph{The ticketing and information desks should be visible from the main entrance, they should be on the right hand side of the lobby from the main entrance, and they should be on the same side fo the lobby as the  entrance.}
\end{description}

After obtaining a ticket most visitors will be trying to locate the entrance to the exhibitions. Therefore, exhibition entrances should be clearly visible from several parts of the lobby, including the ticketing desk, information desk, and a central lobby location, to make it easy for visitors to find where they need to go. 
\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 8:] \emph{Exhibit entrances should be visible from the ticketing desk, information desk, and a central lobby location.}
\end{description}

Bathrooms are an important services for museum visitors. Surprisingly, the place of the bathroom can have an impact on how long visitors stay in the museum. Studies \cite{tbd} have found that bathrooms that are located on the same side of the lobby as the entrance / exit encourage visitors to leave earlier compared to museums with bathrooms on the opposing side of the lobby from the entrance / exit. Additionally, the doorways to the bathroom should be private to maintain as much privacy in the bathroom as possible.

\begin{description}
\item[Requirement 9:] \emph{The bathroom should be on the opposing side of the lobby from the entrance / exit and the bathroom doorways should be private.}
\end{description}


\section{Application of CRR for Museum Design}
This section presents the application of the CRR for validating art museum design requirements using a real world scenario. The first part of this section introduces the museums, including illustrations of their floor plans, which will be used in the case study and gives a brief overview of process of importing the designs into the CRR. The second part of this section presents the results of applying the museum design requirements identified in the beginning of this Chapter to the museum design presented here within the CRR.

%This use case is from the perspective of a museum designer and covers the process of importing a museums design from an architectural design tool (ArchiCAD) into the CRR, the building of museum requirements using architectural concepts and QSA, and finally validation of the requirements using the CRR query engine. 

\subsection{Museum Designs and Import}
The museum floor plans used in this case study are based off the Asian Art Wing of the Philadelphia Museum of Art \cite{PhiladelphiaArtMuseum} and the lobby of the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. The Philadelphia Museum of Art will be used for the demonstration of the gallery requirements and the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian will be used for the demonstration of the lobby requirements. The motivation behind basing the designs off a real world museums instead of a contrived examples is to demonstrate the CRR in a real world context with regards to the applicability of museum design requirements using a real world design examples.

\begin{figure}[H]

 \subfloat[2nd Floor]{\label{art museum}\includegraphics[width=78mm]{philadelphiamuseum}}

 \subfloat[Asian Wing]{\label{asian wing}\includegraphics[width=45mm]{asianwing}}
 \caption{Philadelphia Art Museum Floor-plan - Source \cite{philadelphiamusem}}
\label{art-museums}
\end{figure}

Gallery rooms 226 and 238 - 244 of the Asian Wing at the \emph{Philadelphia Museum of Art} and the lobby of the \emph{Museu Calouste Gulbenkian} were manually built in ArchiCAD 14. The dimension and scale of the rooms where obtained from the museum to ensure as much accuracy to the real design as possible. Benches, display cases and states were manually added to demonstrate some of the museum requirements. Figure \ref{art museum in archiCAD} shows the floor plans in ArchiCAD.

\end{figure}

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=100mm]{lobby}
%\caption{Asian Wing in ArchiCAD}
%\label{art museum in archiCAD}
%\end{figure}

Once an initial design has been built in ArchiCAD it can be imported into the CRR via a Multi-Modal Spatial Data Access Framework for Architectural Design \cite{carl}. This framework provides the CRR with access to the representational information such as structural spatial and containment relationships involving rooms/spaces and architectural entities. The current version of this framework does not provide spatial data for artefactual representations or wall to door/window containment relationships, so these need to be manually added to the CRR's design representation model.    


\subsection{Validating Museum Requirements}
This section presents the results of applying the museum requirements identified in the beginning of this Chapter against the museum floor plans imported in the previous section. 

Table \ref{} shows the CRR query used for each museum requirement along with any violations found in the design. Each violation can be visually confirmed in the museum design floor plans provided above. The take away from this demonstration is that the CRR is able to check high level design requirements as they occur in real world concrete designs. 

%In this section, the museum requirements identified in the beginning of this Chapter will be check for against the \emph{Philadelphia Museum of Art} and the \emph{Museu Calouste Gulbenkian} floor plan imported in previous section. Checking for design requirements will follow a general pattern of querying the CRR using architectural concepts, QSAs, and qualitative spatial relationships. 

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | p{7.5cm} | p{6cm} |}
    \hline
    Req. & CRR Query & Violations\\ \hline
    GR1 & opposing\_side(\emph{door\_id}, \emph{door\_id}, \emph{room\_id}) & - door4, door5, gallery234 
    													\newline - door2, door1, gallery256 
    													\newline - door3, door6, gallery245 \\ \hline
    GR2 &  &  \\ \hline
    GR3 & island(\emph{display\_id}) & - display4 \\ \hline

    GR5 & artefact\_interference(\emph{id}, \emph{id}) &  \\ \hline
    GR6 & facing\_away(\emph{bench\_id}, \emph{door\_id}) & - bench, door
                               \newline - bench, door \\ \hline
    GR7 & facing\_away(\emph{statue\_id}, \emph{door\_id}) & - statue1, door4 \\ \hline
    GR8 & continuity(\emph{gallery\_id}) &  - gallery344 \\ \hline
    LR1 & right\_side(\emph{door\_id}, \emph{desk\_id})& - no violations \\ \hline
    LR2 & visibility(\emph{door\_id}, \emph{door\_id})& - no violations\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\caption{Spatial Abstractions for Architectural Entities}
\label{spatial abstractions}
\end{table} 

Gallery Requirement 1 specifies that doorways should be positioned on opposing sides of a gallery room. The opposing side relationship can be checked for using the CRR with the following query:
\begin{verbatim}
    ?- opposing_side(door_id, door_id, gallery_id).
\end{verbatim} The opposing side relationship takes three crr\_ids as arguments. In this requirement the first and second arguments refer to doorways and the third refers to the gallery room. This requirement can be checked for in the Philadelphia Museum of Art by making opposing-side queries to the CRR. For the galleries which have doorways on opposing sides the query will respond with a true and will fail when they are not. A failure indicates to the designer that the requirement has been violated. The following two queries show an example of a one query passing and one failing.  
\begin{verbatim}
    ?- opposing_side(door1, door2, gallery244).
    - true.
    ?- opposing_side(door7, door8, gallery233).
    - fail.
\end{verbatim} Visually checking the floor plan in Figure \ref{} in fact shows that doorways door1 and door2 are on opposing sides of gallery244 while doorways door7 and door8 are on the same side of gallery233.


%Gallery Requirement 4 specifies that display cases arrangements should not cut horizontally across the view of a visitor located at a doorway to a gallery. This requirement can be check for using the horizontal rule in the CRR. The horizontal query takes a list of crr\_id that represent a series of objects and a vantage point (in this case a doorway) and returns true if they cut horizontally from the perspective of the vantage point. Give the Philadelphia Museum of Art this requirement can be check for using the following query:
%\begin{verbatim} 
%     ?- horizontal(door1, [dispaly1, display2, display3, display4]).
%      - true.
%\end{verbatim} In this case the query returns true because this sequence of display cases cut horizontally across the view from point of view at doorway 1. Visually checking this in the floor plan show that the display cases do cut horizontally.




%\subsection{A Private Room}
%In a particular apartment, the designer wants the bedroom to be private. Given the definition of privacy in this chapter, privacy entails that the bedroom is on the opposing side of the apartment from the main entrance, the bedroom's doorway does not face towards any other doorways, and the doorway is not visible from the main entrance.

%Using DSpace, the designer can check for privacy of a bedroom by querying the DSpace representation. The query is a Prolog statement that calls the privacy predicate with the bedroom's unique DSpace identifier. The statement will return true if the bedroom meets the constraint defined by privacy and will return fail if it does not. The floor plans in Figure \ref{room-privacy} show two apartments with a private and un-private bedroom. Given these two floor plans DSpace will validate the floor plan that is private based on the spatial characteristics of the design that define privacy. For example, given Figure \ref{fig:private-room-con} has a unique DSpace identifier of \emph{bedroom1} and Figure \ref{fig:private-room-incon} has a unique DSpace identifier of \emph{bedroom2} the privacy query for bedroom1 will respond with \emph{true} while the query for bedroom2 will respond with \emph{fail}: 
%\begin{verbatim}
%   ?- privacy(bedroom1).
%   true.
   
%   ?- privacy(bedroom2).
%   fail.
%\end{verbatim}

%The constraints that define privacy for a room are broken down into three QSAs:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   opposing(main entrance, bedroom, apartment).
%   facing_away(doorway, doorways).
%   not_visible(main entrance, doorway).
%\end{verbatim}
%These three QSA constraints are in turn broken down into qualitative spatial relationships. For example, the opposing side relationship is broken down into SCC relationships for the architectural entities (main entrance, bedroom) point abstractions.
%\begin{verbatim}
%   SCC1(main entrance, apartment centroid, bedroom).
%   SCC2(main entrance, apartment centroid, bedroom).
%   SCC3(main entrance, apartment centroid, bedroom).
%\end{verbatim}
%These SCC relationships are grounded to the quantitative representation via qualification. The SCC constraints are solved for using the orientational constraint solver.

%\subsection{Sink / Doorway Artefact Interaction}
%In a particular bathroom there is a design requirement that there should be no artefactual interactions between bathroom entities to ensure proper circulation throughout the bathroom. This includes the requirement that the functional space of all sinks should not interfere with the functional space of a doorway. 

%TODO: figure for two bathrooms

%Using DSpace a designer can check that there are no artefactual interactions by querying the design representation. The query is a Prolog statement that check for the topological structures of the bathrooms artefactual extension. For example, Figure \ref{?} shows two example bathroom floor plans. Figure \ref{?} shows a bathroom design that is consisted per the requirement and Figure \ref{?} shows a bathroom design that is inconsistent per the requirement. Given these two designs and ids for the sink (\emph{sink55}), and door (\emph{door104}), the following query can be made to check for artefactual interaction:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   artefactual_interaction(sink55, door104).
%\end{verbatim}
%The query will return \emph{true} for Figure \ref{?} and will fail for Figure \ref{?}.

%The $artefactual\_interaction$ predicate is broken down into topological constraints that check for partially overlapping topological relationships between the artefactual extensions of the bathroom doorway and sink. The topological constraints are solved in the topological constraint solver.

\section{Spatial Abstraction of Architectural Entities} \label{spatial abstraction}
The remainder of this section shows how architectural entities and interior designs objects are spatially abstracted into points, directed points, and convex hulls and how they are transformed in DSpace. Table \ref{spatial abstractions} shows which spatial abstractions each architectural entity can be transformed into. 

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | r | c | c | c |}
    \hline
    entity & point & directed point & convex hull\\ \hline
    doorway & X & X & X \\ \hline
    window & X & X & X \\ \hline
    wall & X & X & X \\ \hline
    column & X &  & X \\ \hline
    space & X &  & X \\ \hline
    interior design object & X & X* & X \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\caption{Spatial Abstractions for Architectural Entities}
\label{spatial abstractions}
\end{table} 

\noindent \emph{\large Point} \\
\indent All architectural entities and interior design objects have a point abstraction that is defined as the centroid of the entity's physical polygon space. Figure \ref{point-abs} shows the point abstraction for a doorway. Note that the point is the centroid of the doorway's physical geometry. The point abstraction is used in orientational reasoning and is therefore used as an approximation of the object's location in the design. In general, the centroid is a good point approximation of location because it is a generalization of polygon space as a single point. 
\begin{verbatim}
   point_abstraction(door1, Point) :-
           quantitative_geometry(door1, Quant),
           centroid(Quant, Point).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=70mm]{point-abs}
\caption{Doorway Point Abstraction}
\label{point-abs}
\end{figure}

\noindent \emph{\large Directed Point} \\
\indent Walls, doorways, windows, and some interior design objects have a directed point abstraction. A directed point is represented as a tuple (\emph{Cartesian point}, \emph{direction}). The point is defined as the centroid of the quantitative polygon space, as it is in the point abstraction. The direction is defined either by the user, as is the case for interior design objects, or by an intrinsic spatial property of the entity, as is the case for doorways, walls, and windows.

For these entities, direction is based on the interpretation of the nature of the entity within the context of a design. Formally, direction is interpreted as a vector that emanates from an entity's point abstraction towards the room / space it is contained in. Specifically, direction is defined as the perpendicular vector to the intrinsic x-axis of the object. Figure \ref{dir-point-abs} shows the directed point abstraction for a doorway. Not that the direction is perpendicular to the x-axis of the doorway's physical geometry. Based on this definition there will be two perpendicular lines that define the direction. In this situation, the context of the space in which the entity is located is need to decided which of the two directions to use.  

\begin{verbatim}
   dir_point_abstraction(door1, (Point, Dir), room3) :-
           quantitative_geometry(door1, Quant),
           centroid(Quant, Point),
           direction(Quant, Point, room3, Dir).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]\label{dir-point-abs}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=70mm]{dir-point-abs}
\caption{Doorway Point Abstraction}
\end{figure}

\noindent \emph{\large Convex Hull} \\
\indent All architectural entities have a convex hull abstraction. The convex hull is calculated over the quantitative polygon space by using the divide and conquer convex hull algorithm \cite{tbd}. The result of the algorithm is a convex hull representation that is a list of points sorted in counterclockwise order. Convex hulls are used in topological reasoning.
\begin{verbatim}
   convex_hull_abstraction(door1, ConvexHull).
           quantitative_geometry(door1, Quant),
           convex_hull(convex, ConvexHull).
\end{verbatim}

TODO: figure for convex hull abs
